## Enable High Availability by Using Availability Sets [Guided] (Expected Duration 30 minutes) Challenge Labs All Access Pass , 
HCS-OOS Details In this Challenge Lab, you will configure high availability by using availability sets. 
First, you will create an availability set. Next, you will deploy two Azure virtual machines to the availability set. 
Finally, you will configure load balancing. Note: Once you begin the Challenge Lab. you will not be able to pause. save, or return to your Challenge Lab. 
Please ensure that you have set aside enough time to complete the Challenge Lab before you start.

This Challenge Lab will guide you through configuring high availability for your applications using availability sets and load balancing in Azure. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you complete this challenge:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Create an Availability Set

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create an Availability Set**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Availability Set."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Name, and Region.
   - Configure the settings for Fault Domains and Update Domains.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Deploy Two Azure Virtual Machines to the Availability Set

1. **Create the First Virtual Machine**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, VM Name, Region, and Image.
   - In the "Availability options" section, select "Availability set" and choose the availability set you created.
   - Configure other settings like size, authentication type (e.g., password), and inbound ports (RDP for Windows or SSH for Linux).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

2. **Create the Second Virtual Machine**
   - Repeat the steps above to create a second VM, ensuring it is added to the same availability set.

#### Step 3: Configure Load Balancing

1. **Create a Load Balancer**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Load Balancer."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Name, and Region.
   - Choose the type of load balancer (Public or Internal) and configure other settings.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

2. **Create a Backend Pool**
   - Navigate to the Load Balancer you created.
   - In the left-hand menu, select "Backend pools."
   - Click "Add" to create a new backend pool.
   - Add the two VMs you created earlier to the backend pool.

3. **Create a Health Probe**
   - In the Load Balancer, select "Health probes."
   - Click "Add" to create a new health probe.
   - Configure the probe settings, such as protocol (HTTP/HTTPS/TCP), port, interval, and unhealthy threshold.

4. **Create a Load Balancing Rule**
   - In the Load Balancer, select "Load balancing rules."
   - Click "Add" to create a new load balancing rule.
   - Configure the settings such as frontend IP, backend pool, protocol, port, and health probe.
   - Click "OK" to create the rule.

#### Step 4: Test the Configuration

1. **Connect to the Virtual Machines**
   - Use RDP (for Windows) or SSH (for Linux) to connect to the VMs and ensure they are running correctly.
   - Deploy an application or service on both VMs to simulate real-world usage.

2. **Test Load Balancer**
   - Access the load balancer's public IP or DNS name from a browser or any client application.
   - Ensure that the requests are being distributed across both VMs.
