## Provision an Azure Container Instance [Guided] (Expected Duration 30 minutes) Challenge Labs All Access Pass , 
CSAA-004a Details d In this challenge, you will provision an Azure Container Instance, which will host a container with a custom service, 
and will test the service with a python script and monitor the performance of the container. 
Note: Once you begin a challenge you will not be able to pause. save, or return to your progress. 
Please ensure you have set aside enough time to complete the challenge before you start.

This Challenge Lab will help you provision an Azure Container Instance (ACI) to host a container with a custom service, test the service using a Python script, and monitor the container's performance. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### Step 1: Provision an Azure Container Instance

1. **Create a Container Instance**
   - Go to the Azure portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Containers" > "Container Instances."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Container Name, Region, and Image Source.
   - For Image Source, you can use a public Docker Hub image, a private registry, or Azure Container Registry.
   - Configure additional settings such as CPU, memory, and networking.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Configure the Container to Run a Custom Service

1. **Specify the Container Image**
   - Use an existing image or create a custom Docker image that runs your service.
   - Ensure the Docker image is available in a registry that the Azure Container Instance can access.

2. **Create a Dockerfile (if creating a custom image)**
   - Example Dockerfile:
     ```Dockerfile
     # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
     FROM python:3.9-slim

     # Set the working directory in the container
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
     COPY . /app

     # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
     RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

     # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
     EXPOSE 80

     # Define environment variable
     ENV NAME World

     # Run app.py when the container launches
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```

3. **Push the Docker Image to a Registry**
   - If you are using Azure Container Registry (ACR):
     ```sh
     az acr login --name YourRegistryName
     docker build -t YourRegistryName.azurecr.io/your-image-name:tag .
     docker push YourRegistryName.azurecr.io/your-image-name:tag
     ```

4. **Deploy the Container Instance**
   - Ensure the Container Instance uses the correct image from the registry.

#### Step 3: Test the Service with a Python Script

1. **Write a Python Script to Test the Service**
   - Example Python script:
     ```python
     import requests

     url = "http://<your-container-instance-ip>:<port>/"
     response = requests.get(url)

     if response.status_code == 200:
         print("Service is running successfully!")
     else:
         print("Failed to reach the service.")
     ```

2. **Run the Python Script**
   - Execute the script from your local machine or any environment that can reach the Container Instance.

#### Step 4: Monitor the Performance of the Container

1. **Use Azure Portal to Monitor ACI**
   - Navigate to your Container Instance in the Azure portal.
   - Go to "Metrics" to monitor performance metrics such as CPU and memory usage.
   - Set up alerts if needed to monitor specific metrics.
