## Monitor an Azure Virtual Machine [Guided] (Expected Duration 30 minutes) Challenge Labs All Access Pass , 
HCARM-OOS Details In this challenge, you will create an Azure virtual machine that you will use to verify your monitoring strategy. 
First, you will create a virtual machine that has boot diagnostics enabled. 
Next, you will monitor the startup metrics by using boot diagnostics, and then you will monitor selected metrics on the virtual machine. 
Finally, you will perform guest-level monitoring. and then you will create an alert rule. 
Note: Once you begin a challenge you will not be able to pause, save, or return to your progress. 
Please ensure you have set aside enough time to complete the challenge before you start.

This Challenge Lab is a great opportunity to practice setting up monitoring for an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine with Boot Diagnostics Enabled

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create a New Virtual Machine**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, VM Name, Region, and Image.
   - Ensure boot diagnostics are enabled in the "Management" tab. This can be configured under "Boot diagnostics" by selecting "Enable with custom storage account" or "Enable with managed storage account."
   - Configure other settings like size, authentication type (e.g., password), and inbound ports (RDP for Windows or SSH for Linux).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Monitor Startup Metrics Using Boot Diagnostics

1. **Access Boot Diagnostics**
   - Navigate to the newly created VM in the Azure portal.
   - In the VM's menu, select "Boot diagnostics" under the "Support + troubleshooting" section.
   - You can view the startup logs and screenshots to ensure the VM has booted correctly.

#### Step 3: Monitor Selected Metrics on the Virtual Machine

1. **Configure VM Monitoring**
   - In the VM's menu, select "Metrics" under the "Monitoring" section.
   - Add the metrics you want to monitor, such as CPU usage, disk read/write operations, and network in/out.
   - Customize the time range and granularity as needed.

#### Step 4: Perform Guest-Level Monitoring

1. **Install the Azure Monitoring Agent**
   - In the VM's menu, select "Extensions + applications" under "Settings."
   - Click "Add" and select the "Azure Monitor Agent" or "Log Analytics agent" to install it on the VM.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation and configuration.

2. **Configure Guest-Level Monitoring**
   - After the agent is installed, configure guest-level monitoring by navigating to "Insights" under the "Monitoring" section.
   - This will provide more detailed performance data and logs for your VM.

#### Step 5: Create an Alert Rule

1. **Navigate to Alerts**
   - In the VM's menu, select "Alerts" under the "Monitoring" section.
   - Click "New alert rule."

2. **Configure the Alert Rule**
   - Select the VM as the target resource.
   - Define the condition for the alert, such as CPU usage exceeding a certain threshold.
   - Configure the action group to specify how the alert should be handled (e.g., send an email or trigger a webhook).
   - Provide a name and description for the alert rule.
   - Click "Create alert rule."
