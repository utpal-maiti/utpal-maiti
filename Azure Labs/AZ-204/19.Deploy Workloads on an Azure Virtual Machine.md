## Deploy Workloads on an Azure Virtual Machine [Guided] (Expected Duration 45 minutes) Challenge Labs All Access Pass . 
HCARM-004 Details In this Challenge Lab, you will create an image of an Azure virtual machine that hosts Microsoft Visual Studio. 
First, you will create a virtual machine, and then you will add a data disk to the virtual machine. 
Next, you will capture an image of a generalized version of the virtual machine in Azure. 
Finally, you will create a virtual machine from the image. and then you will create a snapshot of a data disk. 
Note: Once you begin the Challenge Lab, you will not be able to pause, save, or return to your Challenge Lab. 
Please ensure that you have set aside enough time to complete the Challenge Lab before you start.

This Challenge Lab is a great way to gain practical experience with Azure Virtual Machines and image management. Let's go through the steps you'll need to follow:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create a New Virtual Machine**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, VM Name, Region, and Image (select a Windows image that supports Visual Studio).
   - Configure the size, authentication type (e.g., password), inbound ports (RDP), and other settings.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Add a Data Disk to the Virtual Machine

1. **Navigate to the Virtual Machine**
   - Once the VM is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2. **Add a Data Disk**
   - In the VM's menu, select "Disks."
   - Click "Add data disk."
   - Create a new disk or attach an existing disk.
   - Configure the size and type of the disk.
   - Click "Save" to add the disk to the VM.

#### Step 3: Capture an Image of the Generalized Virtual Machine

1. **Generalize the Virtual Machine**
   - Connect to the VM via RDP.
   - Open a command prompt as an administrator.
   - Run the following command to generalize the VM:
     ```sh
     sysprep /oobe /generalize /shutdown
     ```
   - This will prepare the VM for imaging and shut it down.

2. **Capture the Image**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the VM.
   - In the VM's menu, select "Capture."
   - Provide the image name and resource group.
   - Select "Automatically delete this virtual machine after creating the image."
   - Click "Create" to capture the image.

#### Step 4: Create a Virtual Machine from the Image

1. **Create a New VM from the Image**
   - In the Azure portal, select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
   - Select "See all images" and then choose the image you captured.
   - Fill in the required details such as VM Name, Region, and other settings.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 5: Create a Snapshot of a Data Disk

1. **Navigate to the Data Disk**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the VM and then to the "Disks" section.

2. **Create a Snapshot**
   - Select the data disk you want to snapshot.
   - Click "Create snapshot."
   - Provide the snapshot name and resource group.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."
