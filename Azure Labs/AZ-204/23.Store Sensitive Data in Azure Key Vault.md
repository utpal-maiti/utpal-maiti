CSMMS-OIO Details In this challenge, you will store sensitive data in a key vault. 
You will first provision a key vault. Then you will set access policy for the key vault. 
You will store a connection string as a secret in the key vault and configure a web app to use the secret. 
Note: Once you begin a challenge you will not be able to pause. save. or return to your progress. 
Please ensure you have set aside enough time to complete the challenge before you start.

Storing sensitive data securely is crucial, and Azure Key Vault is a great tool for this. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you complete the Challenge Lab:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Provision an Azure Key Vault

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create a New Key Vault**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Security" > "Key Vault."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Key Vault Name, and Region.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Set Access Policy for the Key Vault

1. **Navigate to the Key Vault**
   - Once the Key Vault is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2. **Configure Access Policies**
   - In the Key Vault's menu, select "Access policies."
   - Click "Add Access Policy."
   - Configure the permissions for secrets (e.g., Get, List, Set).
   - Assign the access policy to specific users, groups, or applications.
   - Click "Save" to apply the access policies.

#### Step 3: Store a Connection String as a Secret in the Key Vault

1. **Add a Secret**
   - In the Key Vault's menu, select "Secrets."
   - Click "Generate/Import" to add a new secret.
   - Enter the name of the secret (e.g., `MyConnectionString`) and paste the connection string value.
   - Click "Create" to store the secret.

#### Step 4: Configure a Web App to Use the Secret

1. **Navigate to the Web App**
   - If you don't have a web app already, create one by selecting "Create a resource" > "Web" > "Web App."
   - Navigate to the web app in the Azure portal.

2. **Set Up Identity for the Web App**
   - In the web app's menu, select "Identity" under "Settings."
   - Enable the "System-assigned managed identity."
   - Click "Save."

3. **Grant the Web App Access to the Key Vault**
   - Go back to the Key Vault's "Access policies."
   - Add an access policy to grant the web app's managed identity the necessary permissions (e.g., Get) to access the secrets.
   - Click "Save" to update the access policies.

4. **Configure the Web App to Use the Secret**
   - In the web app's menu, select "Configuration" under "Settings."
   - Add a new application setting with the name `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` (or whatever your app expects) and the value as the Key Vault reference:
     ```plaintext
     @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://your-key-vault-name.vault.azure.net/secrets/MyConnectionString/)
     ```

5. **Update Web App Code to Use the Configuration Setting**
   - Ensure your web app code retrieves the connection string from the configuration settings.
   - Example in ASP.NET Core:
     ```csharp
     public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
     {
         var connectionString = Configuration["ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection"];
         services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
             options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
     }
     ```
