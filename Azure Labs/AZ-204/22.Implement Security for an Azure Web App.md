## Implement Security for an Azure Web App [Guided] (Expected Duration 30 minutes) Details Challenge Labs All Access Pass , 
ANS-006 In this Challenge Lab, you will deploy an Azure web app that uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication. 
First, you will create an Azure web app. Next, you will deploy code from a public GitHub repository to the web app. 
Finally, you will modify the security configuration of the web app. and then you will test the secure web app. 
Note: Once you begin the Challenge Lab. you will not be able to pause, save, or return to your Challenge Lab. 
Please ensure that you have set aside enough time to complete the Challenge Lab before you start.

This Challenge Lab will walk you through deploying an Azure web app with Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Let's break down the steps you'll need to follow:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### Step 1: Create an Azure Web App

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create a New Web App**
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Web" > "Web App."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Web App Name, Region, and Runtime stack.
   - Configure additional settings as needed (e.g., App Service Plan).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Step 2: Deploy Code from a Public GitHub Repository to the Web App

1. **Navigate to Your Web App**
   - Once the web app is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2. **Set Up Deployment Center**
   - In the left-hand menu, select "Deployment Center."
   - Choose "GitHub" as the source.
   - Authenticate with GitHub and select the repository and branch you want to deploy.
   - Configure the build settings as needed.
   - Click "Save" to set up continuous deployment.

#### Step 3: Modify the Security Configuration of the Web App

1. **Configure Microsoft Entra ID Authentication**
   - In the web app's menu, select "Authentication" under "Settings."
   - Click "Add identity provider" and select "Microsoft Entra ID."
   - Follow the prompts to configure the authentication settings, including the redirect URI and required permissions.

2. **Update the App Registration in Microsoft Entra ID**
   - Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) (Azure Active Directory) in the Azure portal.
   - Find the app registration for your web app.
   - Update the redirect URI to match the one configured in the web app's authentication settings.
   - Configure any additional settings such as API permissions if needed.

#### Step 4: Test the Secure Web App

1. **Access the Web App**
   - Open the web app URL in a browser.
   - You should be redirected to the Microsoft Entra ID login page.

2. **Test the Authentication**
   - Log in with your Microsoft Entra ID credentials.
   - Verify that you are successfully authenticated and can access the web app.
