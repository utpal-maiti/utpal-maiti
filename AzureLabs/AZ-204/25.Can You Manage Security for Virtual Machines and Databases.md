## Can You Manage Security for Virtual Machines and Databases? [Expert] (Expected Duration 1 hours) Challenge Labs All Access Pass .
SDA-OIO Details In this challenge, you will manage security for virtual machines and databases. 
First, you will create a virtual machine, and then you will enable security recommendations for the virtual machine. 
Next, you will enable Azure Defender for SQL for a new Azure SQL database, and then you will perform a vulnerability assessment. 
Finally, you will deploy an Azure Cosmos DB account, and then you will use role-based access control (RBAC) to control security access to the Azure Cosmos DB account. 
Note: Once you begin the challenge lab. you will not be able to pause, save, or exit and then return to your challenge lab. 
Please ensure that you have set aside enough time to complete the challenge lab before you start.

Managing security for virtual machines and databases is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your data. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to help you through the Challenge Lab:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Part 1: Create a Virtual Machine

1. **Create a Virtual Machine**
   - Go to the Azure portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Select "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, VM Name, Region, and Image.
   - Configure additional settings like size, authentication type (e.g., password), and inbound ports (RDP for Windows or SSH for Linux).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Part 2: Enable Security Recommendations for the Virtual Machine

1. **Navigate to Security Center**
   - In the Azure portal, go to "Security Center."
   - In the left-hand menu, select "Security policy" under "Policy & compliance."

2. **Enable Security Recommendations**
   - Find and select the subscription where your VM is located.
   - Click on "View effective policy" and enable the relevant security recommendations for virtual machines.
   - Ensure that recommendations such as endpoint protection, disk encryption, and vulnerability assessment are enabled.

#### Part 3: Enable Azure Defender for SQL for a New Azure SQL Database

1. **Create an Azure SQL Database**
   - In the Azure portal, select "Create a resource" > "Databases" > "SQL Database."
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Database Name, Server, and Pricing Tier.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

2. **Enable Azure Defender for SQL**
   - Navigate to the SQL Database you created.
   - In the SQL Database's menu, select "Microsoft Defender for Cloud."
   - Enable Azure Defender for SQL to protect your database from potential threats.

#### Part 4: Perform a Vulnerability Assessment

1. **Configure Vulnerability Assessment**
   - In the SQL Database's menu, select "Security" > "Vulnerability assessment."
   - Click "Scan" to start a vulnerability assessment.
   - Review the assessment report and address any identified vulnerabilities.

#### Part 5: Deploy an Azure Cosmos DB Account

1. **Create an Azure Cosmos DB Account**
   - In the Azure portal, select "Create a resource" > "Databases" > "Azure Cosmos DB."
   - Choose the SQL API.
   - Fill in the required details such as Resource Group, Account Name, and Region.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

#### Part 6: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to Control Security Access to the Azure Cosmos DB Account

1. **Navigate to the Cosmos DB Account**
   - Once the Cosmos DB account is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2. **Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - In the Cosmos DB's menu, select "Access control (IAM)."
   - Click "Add" to add a new role assignment.
   - Select the role you want to assign (e.g., Cosmos DB Contributor) and choose the user, group, or service principal.
   - Click "Save" to apply the role assignment.
