## Access a Public Storage Container from an ASP.NET Web App [Guided] (Expected Duration 30 minutes) Challenge Labs All Access Pass . 
CSSD-OOI Details In this challenge. you will write code to access an Azure Storage account used by the web app. 
First, you will write code in Visual Studio to create a container that has public blob access, and then you will upload test files to the container. 
Next, you will write code to retrieve the URLs of the uploaded files. 
Finally, you will test the configuration by using a test page provided with the web app. 
Note: Once you begin a challenge you will not be able to pause, save, or return to your progress. 
Please ensure you have set aside enough time to complete the challenge before you start.

This Challenge Lab sounds like a fantastic exercise in working with Azure Storage and ASP.NET. Let's break down the steps you need to follow:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Visual Studio**
   - Open Visual Studio and create a new ASP.NET web application.
   - Choose the appropriate template for a web app.

2. **Create a Public Blob Container**
   - In the Azure portal, create a new Storage Account if you don't already have one.
   - Create a Blob Container within this Storage Account and set its access level to "Container" (public access).

```csharp
// Install the Azure.Storage.Blobs NuGet package
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

string connectionString = "your_storage_account_connection_string";
string containerName = "your_container_name";

// Create a BlobServiceClient
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);

// Create the container and set the access level to public
BlobContainerClient containerClient = await blobServiceClient.CreateBlobContainerAsync(containerName, Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models.PublicAccessType.BlobContainer);
```

3. **Upload Test Files to the Container**
   - Upload files to the container using the following code:

```csharp
string localFilePath = "path_to_your_local_file";
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient(Path.GetFileName(localFilePath));

// Upload the file
await blobClient.UploadAsync(localFilePath, true);
```

4. **Retrieve URLs of Uploaded Files**
   - Write code to get the URLs of the blobs in the container:

```csharp
// List all blobs in the container
await foreach (BlobItem blobItem in containerClient.GetBlobsAsync())
{
    BlobClient client = containerClient.GetBlobClient(blobItem.Name);
    Console.WriteLine($"Blob URL: {client.Uri}");
}
```

5. **Test the Configuration Using a Test Page**
   - Create a test page in your ASP.NET web app to display the URLs of the uploaded files.
   - Use the code above to retrieve the URLs and display them on the page.
