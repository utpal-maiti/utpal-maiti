## Can You Create a Secure Web App? [Expert] (Expected Duration 1 hours) Challenge Labs All Access Pass , 
ANS-010 Details In this Challenge Lab, you will create a secure web app. 
First, you will create an Azure API Management instance to host and publish your APIs, 
and then you will add IAM role assignments for a developer. Next, you will create a web app as a developer, 
and then you will configure Microsoft Entra ID authentication for the web app. 
Finally. you will configure network encryption by using HTTPS, 
and then you will create a new API by using the OpenAPl specification. 
Note: Once you begin the Challenge Lab, you will not be able to pause, 
save, or return to your Challenge Lab. 
Please ensure that you have set aside enough time to complete the Challenge Lab before you start.

This sounds like a comprehensive Challenge Lab! Here are the key steps you'll need to follow to create a secure web app using Azure API Management and Microsoft Entra ID authentication:

### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. **Create an Azure API Management (APIM) Instance**
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to "API Management Services."
   - Click "Add" to create a new APIM instance.
   - Fill in the required details such as name, resource group, and pricing tier.
   - Review and create the APIM instance.

2. **Add IAM Role Assignments for a Developer**
   - Once the APIM instance is created, go to the "Access control (IAM)" tab.
   - Click on "Add role assignment."
   - Select the appropriate role (e.g., API Developer) and assign it to the developer's Azure AD account.

3. **Create a Web App**
   - Navigate to "App Services" in the Azure portal.
   - Click "Add" to create a new web app.
   - Fill in the required details such as name, resource group, and runtime stack.
   - Review and create the web app.

4. **Configure Microsoft Entra ID Authentication**
   - In the web app, go to the "Authentication" section.
   - Click on "Add identity provider" and select "Microsoft Entra ID."
   - Follow the prompts to configure the authentication settings, including redirect URIs and permissions.

5. **Configure Network Encryption Using HTTPS**
   - In the web app settings, go to the "TLS/SSL settings."
   - Ensure that "HTTPS Only" is turned on to enforce secure connections.
   - Optionally, configure custom domains and certificates if needed.

6. **Create a New API Using OpenAPI Specification**
   - Navigate back to the APIM instance.
   - Go to the "APIs" section and click "Add API."
   - Select "OpenAPI" as the source and upload your OpenAPI specification file.
   - Configure the API settings and publish it.

### Important Notes:
- **Preparation**: Make sure you have all the necessary credentials and permissions before starting.
- **Time Management**: Allocate enough time to complete the lab without interruptions, as pausing or saving is not allowed.
