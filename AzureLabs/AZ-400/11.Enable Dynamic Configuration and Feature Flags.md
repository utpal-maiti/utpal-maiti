Enabling dynamic configuration and feature flags is a powerful practice in DevOps that aligns perfectly with your goals for improving secure pipelines and quality assurance, especially as part of the AZ-400 lab series.

### 🧩 What Are Feature Flags?

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles) are a technique that allows teams to enable or disable application features without deploying new code. This is incredibly useful for:

- **Testing in production** safely
- **Rolling out features gradually** (canary releases)
- **A/B testing** different user experiences
- **Quickly disabling features** in case of issues

### ⚙️ Enabling Dynamic Configuration

Dynamic configuration allows applications to update their settings or behaviors at runtime without restarting the application. You can use services like:

- **Azure App Configuration** – Stores feature flags and settings securely
- **Azure Key Vault** – Integrates secrets and config values with your pipelines
- **LaunchDarkly / Flagsmith** – For advanced targeting and rollout controls

### 🔧 How to Enable in Azure DevOps

Here’s a simplified flow:

1. **Create Feature Flags** in Azure App Configuration
2. **Use SDKs** (like .NET Core or Node.js libraries) to fetch feature states
3. **Enable Targeting** – Roll out flags based on users, regions, or groups
4. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines** – Configure flags via YAML or pipeline variables
5. **Monitor & Audit** – Use Application Insights to track flag performance and usage

This approach also complements your work on release gates and secure deployments—feature flags add flexibility without sacrificing control.
