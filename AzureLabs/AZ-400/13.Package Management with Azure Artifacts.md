Azure Artifacts is a key component of **Azure DevOps** that supports **package management** for your development and DevOps workflows. It plays a crucial role in the **AZ-400T00-A: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** course by enabling secure, scalable, and integrated package handling.

## 📦 What is Azure Artifacts?

Azure Artifacts allows you to **create, host, and share packages** across your organization. It supports multiple package types:

- **NuGet** (.NET)
- **npm** (Node.js)
- **Maven** (Java)
- **Python**
- **Universal Packages** (any file type)

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **Feeds**

- A **feed** is a container for packages.
- You can create **scoped feeds** for teams or projects.
- Control access using **Azure DevOps security groups**.

### 2. **Upstream Sources**

- Connect to **public registries** (e.g., NuGet.org, npmjs.com).
- Cache packages locally to improve reliability and performance.

### 3. **Retention Policies**

- Automatically clean up old or unused packages.
- Save storage and maintain a clean feed.

### 4. **Integration with Pipelines**

- Use Azure Artifacts in **CI/CD pipelines** to publish and consume packages.
- Example: Publish a NuGet package after a successful build.

```yaml
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: 'push'
    packagesToPush: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/*.nupkg'
    publishVstsFeed: 'your-feed-id'
```
