### üõ†Ô∏è **Configuring Agent Pools in Azure DevOps**

Agent pools are essential for managing how jobs run in your pipelines. Here's a quick guide:

#### **What They Are**

- Agent pools are collections of agents that execute your pipeline tasks (like builds or deployments).
- You can use Microsoft-hosted agents or set up your own self-hosted agents in pools.

#### **Key Configuration Steps**

- Go to **Project settings ‚Üí Agent pools**
- Choose or create a pool:
  - **Microsoft-hosted**: Ready-to-go, maintained by Azure DevOps.
  - **Self-hosted**: You install and manage the agent (useful for custom tools or network access).
- Assign permissions so specific pipelines can access the pool.

#### **Tips for Managing Pools**

- Use separate pools for isolated environments (e.g., staging vs production).
- Monitor agent usage and jobs queue times to scale as needed.
- Tag agents to target specific capabilities (like OS or installed software).

### üîÑ **Pipeline Styles: Classic vs YAML**

Understanding the styles helps you choose the right structure for different scenarios.

| Style                   | Features                  | Pros                         | Cons                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Classic (GUI-based)** | Drag-and-drop tasks       | Easy for beginners           | Less flexible          |
| **YAML (Code-based)**   | Defined in a `.yaml` file | Version-controlled, reusable | Steeper learning curve |

#### üìã **Classic Pipelines**

- UI-based configuration through Azure DevOps portal.
- Good for quick setups or less complex workflows.

#### üìÑ **YAML Pipelines**

- Stored in source control alongside code.
- Ideal for advanced DevOps practices like Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).
- Supports templates, conditions, and multi-stage deployments.
