To enable **Continuous Integration (CI)** with Azure Pipelines as part of the **AZ-400T00-A Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** lab series, here’s a structured overview to guide you through the process:

### 🛠️ Key Steps to Enable CI in Azure Pipelines

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps Project**

   - Go to your team project in Azure DevOps.
   - Select **Pipelines > Pipelines**.

2. **Create or Edit a Pipeline**

   - If using an existing pipeline (e.g., PartsUnlimitedE2E), click **Edit**.
   - To create a new one, click **New Pipeline** and choose your source repository.

3. **Choose Pipeline Editor**

   - You can use the **classic editor** or define your pipeline using **YAML**.
   - For beginners, the classic editor provides a visual interface.

4. **Select a Template**

   - Apply a relevant template (e.g., ASP.NET) to define build steps.

5. **Configure CI Trigger**

   - Go to the **Triggers** tab.
   - Check **Enable continuous integration** to automatically trigger builds when code is committed.

6. **Customize Build Options**

   - Use the **Variables** tab to set build parameters.
   - Use the **Options** tab to configure workflow behaviors.

7. **Save and Run**
   - Save your pipeline and commit changes to test the CI trigger.
