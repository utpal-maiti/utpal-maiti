Configuring pipelines as code with YAML is a key skill in the **AZ-400T00-A: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** course.
Here's a quick breakdown to help you get started:

### 🛠️ What You'll Learn in This Lab

- Define build and release pipelines using **YAML syntax** instead of the visual designer
- Store pipeline definitions in the same repo as your application code
- Use **multi-stage YAML pipelines** for CI/CD workflows
- Apply templates and reuse pipeline components across projects

### 🧪 Lab Setup Overview

To complete the lab, you'll need:

- An **Azure DevOps organization** (create one if needed)
- An **Azure subscription** with appropriate roles (Owner in subscription, Global Admin in Entra ID)
- A supported browser like Microsoft Edge

### 📄 YAML Pipeline Basics

Here’s a simple example of a YAML pipeline:

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '14.x'
    displayName: 'Install Node.js'

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm run build
    displayName: 'Build project'
```

### 📚 Official Lab Instructions
