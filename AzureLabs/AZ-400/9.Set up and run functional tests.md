To set up and run functional tests in the **AZ-400T00-A: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** lab series, you‚Äôll be working within **Module 03: Design and implement a release strategy**. Here's a breakdown of what you'll be doing:

### üß™ Lab Overview

Functional tests validate your application from the user's perspective, ensuring that complete workflows behave as expected. This lab focuses on integrating these tests into a CI pipeline for a .NET application.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- A working Azure DevOps organization
- Microsoft Edge or another supported browser
- A sample .NET application (like eShopOnWeb)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Set Up and Run Functional Tests

1. **Create or Use an Existing Azure DevOps Project**

   - Set up your repo and pipeline environment.

2. **Organize Test Projects**

   - Place functional test projects in `tests/FunctionalTests/*.csproj`.

3. **Configure CI Pipeline**

   - Use YAML to define your pipeline.
   - Add a task to run functional tests:
     ```yaml
     - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
       displayName: Functional Tests
       inputs:
         command: 'test'
         projects: 'tests/FunctionalTests/*.csproj'
     ```

4. **Run the Pipeline**

   - Trigger the pipeline and verify that functional tests execute successfully.

5. **Review Results**
   - Check test outcomes in the Azure DevOps portal to ensure all scenarios pass.
