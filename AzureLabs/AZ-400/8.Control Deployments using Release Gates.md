The **"Control Deployments using Release Gates"** lab from the AZ-400T00-A course is all about enhancing deployment control and reliability in Azure DevOps pipelines.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what this lab covers:

### 🚦 What Are Release Gates?

Release gates are automated checks that must pass before a deployment can proceed. They help ensure:

- Application health is stable
- No critical bugs are active
- Monitoring tools (like Application Insights) show no alerts

### 🛠️ Lab Objectives

You'll learn to:

- Configure a release pipeline with multiple environments
- Add **pre-deployment** and **post-deployment gates** to control flow
- Use tools like Azure Monitor and Work Items to validate conditions
- Ensure deployments only proceed when criteria are met

### 🧪 Example Scenario

In the lab, you’ll set up a release for an Azure Web App:

- Deploy to **DevTest** only if there are no blocking bugs
- Mark DevTest complete only if **Application Insights** shows no active alerts
