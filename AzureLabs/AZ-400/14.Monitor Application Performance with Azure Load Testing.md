Monitoring application performance using **Azure Load Testing** is a critical skill covered in the **AZ-400T00-A: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** course. It helps ensure your applications can handle expected (and unexpected) traffic under real-world conditions.

## ðŸš€ What is Azure Load Testing?

**Azure Load Testing** is a fully managed service that enables you to generate high-scale load, simulate real-world traffic, and monitor application performance and reliability.

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

### 1. **Test Creation**

- Use **Apache JMeter scripts** or create tests directly in the Azure portal.
- Define **virtual users**, **ramp-up time**, and **test duration**.

### 2. **Performance Metrics**

- Monitor:
  - **Response time**
  - **Throughput**
  - **Error rate**
  - **Server-side metrics** (CPU, memory, etc.)
- Integrates with **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights**.

### 3. **Test Scenarios**

- Simulate:
  - Load spikes
  - Steady traffic
  - Gradual ramp-up
- Useful for **stress testing**, **baseline testing**, and **capacity planning**.

### 4. **CI/CD Integration**

- Integrate with **Azure Pipelines**, **GitHub Actions**, or other CI/CD tools.
- Example YAML snippet for Azure Pipelines:

```yaml
- task: AzureLoadTest@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'MyServiceConnection'
    loadTestConfigFile: 'loadtest.yaml'
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Use Case

1. **Create a JMeter script** simulating user login and data retrieval.
2. **Upload it to Azure Load Testing** and configure test parameters.
3. **Run the test** and monitor:
   - Average response time
   - Number of failed requests
   - Resource utilization on backend services
4. **Analyze results** to identify bottlenecks or scaling issues.
