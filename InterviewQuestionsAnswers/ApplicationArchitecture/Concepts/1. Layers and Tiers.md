### **Layers and Tiers in Application Architecture**

#### **Layers: Logical Separation of Components**

1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - **Role**: This is the user interface (UI) that interacts with the user.
    - **Purpose**: Handles the display of data and user inputs.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**:
    - **Role**: This layer handles the business logic and rules.
    - **Purpose**: Manages the core functionality of the application, processing user inputs, and making business decisions.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**:
    - **Role**: This layer interacts with the database or data storage.
    - **Purpose**: Manages the communication between the application and the database, ensuring data is stored and retrieved efficiently.

4. **Database Layer**:
    - **Role**: This is where the actual data resides.
    - **Purpose**: Stores the data in a structured format for easy access and management.

#### **Tiers: Physical Separation of Components**

1. **Single-Tier**: All components are on a single physical layer, such as a desktop application where the UI, business logic, and data access are all on the same machine.

2. **Two-Tier**: Typically consists of a client and server. The client contains the presentation layer, and the server contains the business logic and data access layers.

3. **Three-Tier**: Separates the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer into three different physical locations, often involving a client, an application server, and a database server.

4. **N-Tier**: Expands on the three-tier architecture by adding more layers, such as additional servers for load balancing, caching, or microservices. This provides greater scalability and flexibility.
