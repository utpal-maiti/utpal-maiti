Testing and debugging in Next.js are crucial for ensuring a smooth development experience and reliable applications. Here’s a breakdown of key techniques:

### **Debugging in Next.js**
1. **Using VS Code Debugger** – You can set up debugging configurations in `.vscode/launch.json` to debug both server-side and client-side code.
2. **Browser DevTools** – Chrome and Firefox DevTools allow you to inspect network requests, console logs, and React components.
3. **Development Mode** – Running `npm run dev` enables hot module replacement and detailed error messages.
4. **Source Maps** – Next.js provides full source maps, making it easier to trace errors back to the original code.

### **Testing in Next.js**
1. **Unit Testing** – Use Jest and React Testing Library to test individual components.
2. **Integration Testing** – Ensures different parts of your application work together correctly.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** – Cypress or Playwright can be used to simulate user interactions.
4. **Performance Testing** – Lighthouse and Web Vitals help analyze performance bottlenecks.
