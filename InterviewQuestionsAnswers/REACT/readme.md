Types of React Applications
React is a versatile JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Based on their functionality, architecture, and use cases, React applications can be categorized into several types:

1. Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
   Load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content.
   Ideal for small to medium-sized applications.
   Examples: Gmail, Facebook, Twitter.
2. Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)
   Consist of multiple HTML pages, each with its own React component tree.
   Suitable for larger, more complex applications.
   Examples: Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia.
3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
   Provide a native app-like experience to users.
   Built using React, HTML, CSS, and modern web technologies.
   Examples: Twitter Lite, Pinterest, Uber.
4. Hybrid Mobile Apps
   Built using React Native, which allows for shared code between iOS and Android.
   Ideal for cross-platform mobile app development.
   Examples: Instagram, Facebook, Walmart.
5. Desktop Applications
   Built using Electron or similar frameworks.
   Allow for the creation of desktop applications using web technologies.
   Examples: Slack, Visual Studio Code, WhatsApp Desktop.
6. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Applications
   Render React components on the server.
   Ideal for SEO optimization and faster page loads.
   Examples: Next.js, Gatsby, Create React App with SSR.
7. Static Site Generation (SSG) Applications
   Pre-render React components at build time.
   Suitable for blogs, documentation sites, and marketing websites.
   Examples: Gatsby, Next.js, Create React App with SSG.
