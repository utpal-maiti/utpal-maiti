In React, the concept of "containers" is often used to describe a type of component that primarily deals with managing state and logic, rather than presentation and UI. Containers are sometimes referred to as "smart" or "stateful" components. They are responsible for fetching data, handling user interactions, and passing data down to presentational components (also known as "dumb" or "stateless" components) which are focused on rendering UI.

### Key Characteristics of Containers

1. **State Management**: Containers manage the state of the application or a part of it. They use hooks like `useState`, `useReducer`, or connect to a global state using context or libraries like Redux.

2. **Data Fetching**: Containers are responsible for fetching data from APIs or other sources and passing it down to presentational components.

3. **Event Handling**: Containers handle user interactions and events, such as form submissions, button clicks, and other actions.

4. **Passing Props**: Containers pass data and event handlers as props to presentational components.

### Example of a Container Component

Let's walk through an example of a container component in React.

#### 1. DataFetchingContainer.js

This container component fetches data from an API and manages the state.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import UserList from './UserList';

const DataFetchingContainer = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setUsers(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        setError(err.message);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return <UserList users={users} />;
};

export default DataFetchingContainer;
```

#### 2. UserList.js

This is a presentational component that receives data as props and renders it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const UserList = ({ users }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User List</h2>
      <ul>
        {users.map(user => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserList;
```

### Example with Redux

In more complex applications, you might use a state management library like Redux. In this case, containers are often connected to the Redux store to manage state and dispatch actions.

#### 1. UserContainer.js

This container component is connected to the Redux store and fetches user data.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchUsers } from './userActions';
import UserList from './UserList';

const UserContainer = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const users = useSelector(state => state.users.data);
  const loading = useSelector(state => state.users.loading);
  const error = useSelector(state => state.users.error);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchUsers());
  }, [dispatch]);
