`Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WaitAll` are both used to handle multiple tasks in C#, but they differ in how they work and how they should be used. Let's dive into their differences and use cases:

### `Task.WhenAll`

`Task.WhenAll` is used to asynchronously wait for multiple tasks to complete. It returns a single task that represents the completion of all the tasks passed to it. This method is non-blocking and is typically used with `await`.

#### Use Case:
- **Asynchronous Operations**: When you want to run multiple tasks concurrently and wait for all of them to complete without blocking the calling thread.

#### Example:
```csharp
public async Task PerformMultipleTasksAsync()
{
    Task task1 = Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    Task task2 = Task.Delay(2000);
    Task task3 = Task.Delay(3000);

    await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3); // Asynchronously wait for all tasks to complete
    Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed.");
}
```

### `Task.WaitAll`

`Task.WaitAll` is used to synchronously wait for multiple tasks to complete. It blocks the calling thread until all the tasks have finished.

#### Use Case:
- **Synchronous Operations**: When you need to wait for multiple tasks to complete but do not want to use asynchronous programming or `await`.

#### Example:
```csharp
public void PerformMultipleTasks()
{
    Task task1 = Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    Task task2 = Task.Delay(2000);
    Task task3 = Task.Delay(3000);

    Task.WaitAll(task1, task2, task3); // Synchronously wait for all tasks to complete
    Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed.");
}
```

### Key Differences:

- **Asynchronous vs Synchronous**:
  - `Task.WhenAll` is asynchronous and can be awaited.
  - `Task.WaitAll` is synchronous and blocks the calling thread.

- **Return Type**:
  - `Task.WhenAll` returns a `Task` that can be awaited.
  - `Task.WaitAll` returns void and cannot be awaited.

- **Error Handling**:
  - With `Task.WhenAll`, exceptions thrown by individual tasks are captured in the returned task, which can be awaited to handle the exceptions.
  - With `Task.WaitAll`, exceptions thrown by individual tasks are aggregated and thrown as an `AggregateException`.

### Example Comparison:

```csharp
public async Task ExampleComparison()
{
    // Using Task.WhenAll
    Task task1 = Task.Run(() => throw new InvalidOperationException("Task 1 error"));
    Task task2 = Task.Run(() => throw new InvalidOperationException("Task 2 error"));

    try
    {
        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception with Task.WhenAll: {ex.Message}");
    }

    // Using Task.WaitAll
    task1 = Task.Run(() => throw new InvalidOperationException("Task 1 error"));
    task2 = Task.Run(() => throw new InvalidOperationException("Task 2 error"));

    try
    {
        Task.WaitAll(task1, task2);
    }
    catch (AggregateException ex)
    {
        foreach (var innerEx in ex.InnerExceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception with Task.WaitAll: {innerEx.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

In this comparison, `Task.WhenAll` allows you to handle exceptions using `await`, while `Task.WaitAll` throws an `AggregateException` containing all the inner exceptions from the tasks.

Choosing between `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WaitAll` depends on whether you want to use asynchronous or synchronous programming. Use `Task.WhenAll` for non-blocking, asynchronous operations and `Task.WaitAll` for blocking, synchronous operations.
