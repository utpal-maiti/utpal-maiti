### LINQ to Objects in C#

**Language Integrated Query (LINQ)** is a powerful feature in C# that allows querying data from various sources like objects, databases, XML, and more in a consistent and readable way. **LINQ to Objects** specifically refers to querying in-memory objects, such as collections (e.g., arrays, lists, dictionaries).

---

### Key Features of LINQ to Objects
1. **Uniform Query Syntax:** LINQ provides a consistent syntax for querying any data source.
2. **Deferred Execution:** Queries are not executed until the results are enumerated, which can improve performance.
3. **Strongly Typed:** LINQ queries are checked at compile time, minimizing runtime errors.
4. **Integration with .NET Collections:** LINQ integrates seamlessly with `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable`.

---

### Syntax

LINQ provides two main query styles:
1. **Query Syntax:** SQL-like syntax, readable and declarative.
2. **Method Syntax:** Uses extension methods and lambda expressions.

---

### Common LINQ Operations

1. **Filtering** - Select items based on conditions (e.g., `where` or `Where`).
2. **Projection** - Transform data into a new form (e.g., `select` or `Select`).
3. **Sorting** - Order items (e.g., `order by` or `OrderBy`).
4. **Grouping** - Group items (e.g., `group by` or `GroupBy`).
5. **Joining** - Combine data from different collections.

### Example Code: LINQ to Objects

#### Data Setup
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Sample data
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

        // Query Syntax
        var evenNumbersQuery = from num in numbers
                               where num % 2 == 0
                               select num;

        Console.WriteLine("Even Numbers (Query Syntax):");
        foreach (var num in evenNumbersQuery)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }

        // Method Syntax
        var evenNumbersMethod = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0);

        Console.WriteLine("\nEven Numbers (Method Syntax):");
        foreach (var num in evenNumbersMethod)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Even Numbers (Query Syntax):
2
4
6
8
10

Even Numbers (Method Syntax):
2
4
6
8
10
```

### Detailed Operations

#### 1. Filtering:
```csharp
var filtered = numbers.Where(num => num > 5);
```

#### 2. Projection:
```csharp
var squared = numbers.Select(num => num * num);
```

#### 3. Sorting:
```csharp
var sortedDescending = numbers.OrderByDescending(num => num);
```

#### 4. Grouping:
```csharp
var grouped = numbers.GroupBy(num => num % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd");
foreach (var group in grouped)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{group.Key}: {string.Join(", ", group)}");
}
```

#### 5. Joining:
```csharp
List<string> names = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };
List<int> ids = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };

var joined = names.Zip(ids, (name, id) => $"{id}: {name}");
```

---

### Deferred vs Immediate Execution

- **Deferred Execution**: Query results are computed when accessed.
  ```csharp
  var query = numbers.Where(num => num > 5); // Not executed yet
  foreach (var num in query) // Executes here
  {
      Console.WriteLine(num);
  }
  ```

- **Immediate Execution**: Results are computed immediately (e.g., using `ToList()` or `Count()`).
  ```csharp
  var immediate = numbers.Where(num => num > 5).ToList(); // Executes now
  ```

### Advantages of LINQ to Objects
1. **Readability:** Simplifies complex queries.
2. **Type Safety:** Errors are caught at compile time.
3. **Reusability:** Queries can be stored and reused.
4. **Integration:** Works well with all .NET collections.

---

### Use Cases in Applications
1. **Data Transformation:** Transform data structures before processing.
2. **Filtering:** Extract specific data from collections.
3. **Reporting:** Aggregate and summarize data.
4. **Search and Sort:** Perform operations on in-memory data efficiently.
