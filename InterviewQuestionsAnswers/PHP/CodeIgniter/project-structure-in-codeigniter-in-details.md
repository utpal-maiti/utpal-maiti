Here’s a **detailed breakdown of the typical project structure in CodeIgniter**, focusing on **CodeIgniter 4**, which is the latest major version and significantly different from CodeIgniter 3 in terms of architecture and structure.

## 📁 CodeIgniter 4 Project Structure

When you create a new CodeIgniter 4 project, the directory structure looks like this:

```
/project-root
│
├── app/                # Application-specific code (MVC)
│   ├── Config/         # Configuration files
│   ├── Controllers/    # Controllers
│   ├── Database/       # Migrations, Seeds, Factories
│   ├── Filters/        # HTTP request filters
│   ├── Helpers/        # Custom helper functions
│   ├── Language/       # Language files for localization
│   ├── Libraries/      # Custom libraries
│   ├── Models/         # Models
│   ├── Views/          # Views (HTML templates)
│   └── ...             # Other app-specific folders
│
├── public/             # Web root (index.php lives here)
│   ├── index.php       # Entry point for the application
│   ├── .htaccess       # Apache config (or web.config for IIS)
│   └── assets/         # CSS, JS, images (optional)
│
├── system/             # Core CodeIgniter framework files (DO NOT MODIFY)
│
├── tests/              # PHPUnit tests
│
├── vendor/             # Composer dependencies
│
├── writable/           # Writable files (logs, cache, uploads)
│   ├── cache/
│   ├── logs/
│   ├── session/
│   └── uploads/
│
├── .env                # Environment-specific configuration

## 🔍 Key Folders Explained

### `app/`
- **Config/**: All configuration files (e.g., database, routes, app settings).
- **Controllers/**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models/**: Interact with the database.
- **Views/**: HTML templates rendered by controllers.
- **Database/**: Contains migrations, seeders, and factories.
- **Filters/**: Middleware-like classes for request filtering.
- **Helpers/**: Custom utility functions.
- **Libraries/**: Custom classes that don’t fit into MVC.

### `public/`
- This is the **web root**. Only this folder should be accessible via the web.
- Contains `index.php`, which bootstraps the application.

### `system/`
- Core CodeIgniter files. **Never modify** this folder directly.

### `writable/`
- Stores logs, cache, session files, and uploads.
- Must be writable by the web server.

### `vendor/`
- Managed by Composer. Contains third-party packages.

## 🛠️ Best Practices for Structure

- **Keep `public/` as the only web-accessible folder**.
- **Use namespaces** and **PSR-4 autoloading** for custom classes.
- **Group related controllers, models, and views** into modules if using HMVC.
- **Avoid modifying `system/`** — extend or override in `app/` instead.
- **Use `.env`** for environment-specific settings (e.g., database credentials).
