Here‚Äôs a detailed guide to **best practices in CodeIgniter**, a powerful PHP framework known for its simplicity, speed, and small footprint. These practices help ensure your application is **secure, maintainable, and scalable**.

---

## üîß 1. **Project Structure & Organization**

- **Follow MVC strictly**: Keep Models, Views, and Controllers separate. Avoid putting business logic in controllers or views.
- **Use HMVC (Hierarchical MVC)** for large applications: This allows modular development and better code reuse.
- **Organize assets**: Store CSS, JS, and images in a well-structured `assets/` directory.

## üîê 2. **Security Best Practices**

- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input using CodeIgniter‚Äôs built-in validation library.
- **XSS & CSRF protection**:
  - Enable CSRF protection in `application/config/config.php`.
  - Use `html_escape()` or `xss_clean()` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Password hashing**: Use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` instead of MD5 or SHA1.
- **Avoid direct script access**: Use `defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');` at the top of PHP files.

## üß± 3. **Model Best Practices**

- **Thin controllers, fat models**: Keep business logic in models, not controllers.
- **Use Active Record**: It prevents SQL injection and makes queries more readable.
- **Use custom model methods**: Encapsulate complex queries in model methods for reuse and clarity.

---

## üß™ 4. **Testing & Debugging**

- **Use environment-based configuration**: Set `ENVIRONMENT` to `development`, `testing`, or `production` in `index.php`.
- **Enable logging**: Configure logging in `application/config/config.php` and use `log_message()` for debugging.
- **Use PHPUnit**: For unit testing models and libraries.

---

## üì¶ 5. **Libraries & Helpers**

- **Use built-in helpers**: Like `form`, `url`, `text`, and `security` to reduce boilerplate code.
- **Create custom libraries/helpers**: For reusable logic across controllers.

---

## üß∞ 6. **Configuration & Environment**

- **Use `.env` files** (in CodeIgniter 4) or separate config files for different environments.
- **Avoid hardcoding URLs or paths**: Use `base_url()` and `site_url()`.

---

## üìÑ 7. **Views & Templates**

- **Use a templating system**: Like Blade (via third-party integration) or a simple layout system to avoid repeating HTML.
- **Escape output**: Always escape variables in views to prevent XSS.

---

## üöÄ 8. **Performance Optimization**

- **Enable caching**: Use output caching or query caching where appropriate.
- **Minimize database queries**: Use joins and batch queries instead of multiple single queries.
- **Use pagination**: For large datasets to reduce load time.

---

## üìö 9. **Documentation & Comments**

- **Comment wisely**: Explain why something is done, not what is done.
- **Use PHPDoc**: For functions and classes to improve IDE support and readability.

---

## üîÑ 10. **Version Control & Deployment**

- **Use Git**: Track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Ignore sensitive files**: Like `application/config/database.php` in `.gitignore`.
- **Automate deployment**: Use tools like GitHub Actions, Envoyer, or Deployer.
