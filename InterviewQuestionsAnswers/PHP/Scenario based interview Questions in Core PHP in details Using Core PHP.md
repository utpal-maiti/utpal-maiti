Sure! Here are some scenario-based interview questions for Core PHP, along with detailed explanations:

### 1. User Authentication System

**Scenario:** You need to create a user authentication system for a website.

- **Question:** How would you implement user login and registration using Core PHP?
- **Answer:**
  - **Registration:** Collect user details (username, email, password) via a form. Hash the password using `password_hash()` and store the details in a MySQL database.
  - **Login:** Verify user credentials by comparing the entered password with the hashed password stored in the database using `password_verify()`. Start a session upon successful login.

### 2. File Upload Handling

**Scenario:** Users need to upload profile pictures.

- **Question:** How would you handle file uploads securely in Core PHP?
- **Answer:**
  - **Form:** Create a form with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.
  - **Validation:** Check file type and size. Use `$_FILES` to handle the file upload. Move the uploaded file to a secure directory using `move_uploaded_file()`.
  - **Security:** Validate file type (e.g., only allow images), limit file size, and use a unique name for the uploaded file to prevent overwriting.

### 3. CRUD Operations

**Scenario:** Develop a simple blog with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Question:** How would you implement CRUD operations in Core PHP?
- **Answer:**
  - **Create:** Use an HTML form to collect blog post data and insert it into a MySQL database using `mysqli_query()` or PDO.
  - **Read:** Fetch and display blog posts from the database using `SELECT` queries.
  - **Update:** Retrieve the post data into a form for editing, then update the database with the new data using `UPDATE` queries.
  - **Delete:** Remove a blog post from the database using `DELETE` queries.

### 4. Session Management

**Scenario:** Implement session management for a shopping cart.

- **Question:** How would you manage sessions in Core PHP for a shopping cart?
- **Answer:**
  - **Start Session:** Use `session_start()` at the beginning of your script.
  - **Add to Cart:** Store cart items in the `$_SESSION` superglobal array.
  - **Remove from Cart:** Update the `$_SESSION` array to remove items.
  - **Destroy Session:** Use `session_destroy()` to clear the cart when the user checks out or logs out.

### 5. Error Handling

**Scenario:** Handle errors gracefully in a web application.

- **Question:** How would you implement error handling in Core PHP?
- **Answer:**
  - **Custom Error Handler:** Set a custom error handler using `set_error_handler()`.
  - **Try-Catch:** Use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.
  - **Logging:** Log errors to a file using `error_log()` for debugging purposes.
  - **User-Friendly Messages:** Display user-friendly error messages while logging detailed errors for developers.

### 6. API Integration

**Scenario:** Integrate a third-party API to fetch weather data.

- **Question:** How would you integrate and use a third-party API in Core PHP?
- **Answer:**
  - **cURL:** Use cURL to make HTTP requests to the API.
  - **JSON Handling:** Parse the JSON response using `json_decode()`.
  - **Display Data:** Extract and display the relevant data from the API response.
