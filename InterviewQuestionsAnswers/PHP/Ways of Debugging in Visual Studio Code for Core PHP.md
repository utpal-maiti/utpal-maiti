Debugging Core PHP in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can be quite efficient with the right setup. Here are the steps to get you started:

### 1. Install PHP Debug Extension

First, you'll need to install the PHP Debug extension in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "PHP Debug" and install the extension by Felix Becker.

### 2. Install and Configure XDebug

XDebug is a PHP extension that helps with debugging. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Download and Install XDebug**: You can download XDebug from the official site.
2. **Configure PHP to Use XDebug**: Add the following lines to your `php.ini` file:
   ```ini
   zend_extension="path/to/xdebug.so"
   xdebug.mode=debug
   xdebug.start_with_request=yes
   xdebug.client_port=9003
   xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
   ```
   Make sure to replace `"path/to/xdebug.so"` with the actual path to the XDebug extension file.

### 3. Configure VS Code for Debugging

1. **Create a `launch.json` File**: This file tells VS Code how to start the debugger. You can create it by going to the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and clicking on "create a launch.json file". Add the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
   	"version": "0.2.0",
   	"configurations": [
   		{
   			"name": "Listen for XDebug",
   			"type": "php",
   			"request": "launch",
   			"port": 9003
   		}
   	]
   }
   ```

### 4. Start Debugging

1. **Set Breakpoints**: Click in the gutter next to the line numbers in your PHP file to set breakpoints.
2. **Start the Debugger**: Go to the Run and Debug view, select "Listen for XDebug" from the dropdown, and click the green play button to start debugging.
3. **Run Your PHP Script**: Make sure your PHP script is running in a way that it can connect to the XDebug server (e.g., through a web server or CLI).

### Additional Tips

- **Use the Debug Console**: You can evaluate expressions and inspect variables in the Debug Console.
- **Watch Variables**: Add variables to the Watch section to monitor their values as you step through your code.
- **Step Through Code**: Use the step over, step into, and step out buttons to navigate through your code.
