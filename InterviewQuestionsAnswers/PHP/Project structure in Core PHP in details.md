Organizing your project structure in Core PHP is crucial for maintaining a scalable, maintainable, and efficient codebase. Here’s a detailed look at a recommended project structure:

### 1. **Root Directory**

The root directory contains the main entry point of your application and other essential files.

```
project-root/
├── public/
├── src/
├── config/
├── vendor/
├── tests/
├── logs/
├── .gitignore
├── composer.json
└── README.md
```

### 2. **Public Directory**

The `public` directory contains files that are accessible to the public, such as the main entry point (`index.php`), CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

```
public/
├── index.php
├── css/
├── js/
└── images/
```

### 3. **Source Directory (`src`)**

The `src` directory contains your PHP source code, organized by functionality. This is where your application logic resides.

```
src/
├── Controller/
├── Model/
└── View/
```

### 4. **Configuration Directory (`config`)**

The `config` directory holds configuration files for your application, such as database settings, environment variables, and other configuration parameters.

```
config/
├── database.php
└── app.php
```

### 5. **Vendor Directory (`vendor`)**

The `vendor` directory is where Composer stores all third-party packages and dependencies. This directory is automatically created when you run `composer install`.

```
vendor/
```

### 6. **Tests Directory (`tests`)**

The `tests` directory contains your automated tests. Organize your tests similarly to your `src` directory to maintain consistency.

```
tests/
├── Controller/
├── Model/
└── View/
```

### 7. **Logs Directory (`logs`)**

The `logs` directory is used to store log files generated by your application. Ensure this directory is writable by the web server.

```
logs/
```

### 8. **Git Ignore File (`.gitignore`)**

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. Common entries include `vendor/`, `logs/`, and environment-specific configuration files.

```
.gitignore
```

### 9. **Composer File (`composer.json`)**

The `composer.json` file is used to manage your project's dependencies. It defines the libraries and packages your project requires.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"monolog/monolog": "^2.0"
	}
}
```

### 10. **Readme File (`README.md`)**

The `README.md` file provides an overview of your project, including installation instructions, usage examples, and other relevant information.

```
README.md
```

### Example of `index.php` in the `public` Directory

The `index.php` file serves as the main entry point for your application. It typically includes the autoloader and initializes the application.

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use App\Controller\HomeController;

$controller = new HomeController();
$controller->index();
?>
```

### Example of a Controller in the `src/Controller` Directory

A simple controller might look like this:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controller;

class HomeController {
    public function index() {
        echo "Welcome to the Home Page!";
    }
}
?>
```

### Example of a Model in the `src/Model` Directory

A basic model might interact with the database like this:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Model;

class User {
    public function getAllUsers() {
        // Database interaction logic
    }
}
?>
```

### Example of a View in the `src/View` Directory

A view file might contain HTML and PHP to render a page:

```php
<!-- src/View/home.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your code organized by separating different concerns (e.g., controllers, models, views).
- **Autoloading**: Use Composer's autoloading feature to automatically load classes.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables to manage configuration settings.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and maintain a clean commit history.
- **Testing**: Write automated tests to ensure your code works as expected.

By following this structure and best practices, you can create a well-organized and maintainable PHP project.
