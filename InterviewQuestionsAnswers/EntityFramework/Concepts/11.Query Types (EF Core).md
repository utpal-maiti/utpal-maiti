In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), queries are used to interact with the database and retrieve data. EF Core supports several query types, each with its own specific way of interacting with the underlying database. These queries can be broadly categorized as follows:

### 1. **LINQ Queries**  
   LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is the most common way to query data in EF Core. It allows you to use C# syntax to write queries that are translated into SQL when executed against a database. LINQ queries in EF Core can be written using method syntax or query syntax.

   - **Method Syntax:**
     The method syntax uses C# extension methods like `Where()`, `Select()`, `OrderBy()`, `FirstOrDefault()`, etc.

     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students
                           .Where(s => s.Age > 18)
                           .OrderBy(s => s.Name)
                           .ToList();
     ```

   - **Query Syntax:**
     Query syntax is more SQL-like, often preferred for complex queries.

     ```csharp
     var students = from s in context.Students
                    where s.Age > 18
                    orderby s.Name
                    select s;
     ```

### 2. **Eager Loading**  
   Eager loading allows you to load related entities as part of the initial query, which can help in optimizing database calls by reducing the number of queries executed.

   Use the `Include()` method to perform eager loading.

   ```csharp
   var students = context.Students
                          .Include(s => s.Courses)
                          .ToList();
   ```

   You can also chain `ThenInclude()` for nested relationships:
   
   ```csharp
   var students = context.Students
                          .Include(s => s.Courses)
                              .ThenInclude(c => c.Instructor)
                          .ToList();
   ```

### 3. **Lazy Loading**  
   Lazy loading is a technique where related data is loaded on-demand. With EF Core, lazy loading requires installing the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies` package and enabling it via the `UseLazyLoadingProxies()` method in the `OnConfiguring` method of `DbContext`.

   ```csharp
   services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
       options.UseLazyLoadingProxies()
              .UseSqlServer(connectionString));
   ```

   Then, EF Core will automatically load related entities when accessed. Example:

   ```csharp
   var student = context.Students.FirstOrDefault();
   var courses = student.Courses; // This triggers lazy loading.
   ```

### 4. **Explicit Loading**  
   Explicit loading is a technique where related data is loaded after the main query is executed, and the developer explicitly controls when to load the related entities.

   Use the `Load()` method for explicit loading:

   ```csharp
   var student = context.Students.FirstOrDefault();
   context.Entry(student).Collection(s => s.Courses).Load();
   ```

   This ensures the related data (`Courses`) is loaded after the `student` entity has been retrieved.

### 5. **Projection Queries**  
   Projection allows you to shape the data into a different structure (like anonymous objects or DTOs). Instead of fetching entities, you can return custom objects, which can improve performance by only selecting the needed columns.

   ```csharp
   var studentNames = context.Students
                              .Where(s => s.Age > 18)
                              .Select(s => new { s.Name, s.Age })
                              .ToList();
   ```

   Or project into a custom DTO:

   ```csharp
   var studentsDTO = context.Students
                            .Where(s => s.Age > 18)
                            .Select(s => new StudentDTO
                            {
                                Name = s.Name,
                                Age = s.Age
                            })
                            .ToList();
   ```

### 6. **Raw SQL Queries**  
   EF Core allows you to run raw SQL queries directly against the database. This is useful for complex queries that are difficult to express in LINQ.

   - For querying data:

     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > {0}", 18).ToList();
     ```

   - For executing commands that do not return data:

     ```csharp
     context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("DELETE FROM Students WHERE Age < {0}", 18);
     ```

   You can also use interpolated strings:

   ```csharp
   var students = context.Students.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > {18}").ToList();
   ```

### 7. **Async Queries**  
   EF Core supports asynchronous queries to improve the performance of web applications. Use the `async` versions of query methods such as `ToListAsync()`, `FirstOrDefaultAsync()`, etc.

   ```csharp
   var students = await context.Students
                                .Where(s => s.Age > 18)
                                .OrderBy(s => s.Name)
                                .ToListAsync();
   ```

   Async queries do not block the thread and allow the application to remain responsive.

### 8. **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**  
   EF Core allows you to apply various filters, sorting, and pagination to your queries.

   - **Filtering:**
     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students
                            .Where(s => s.Age > 18)
                            .ToList();
     ```

   - **Sorting:**
     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students
                            .OrderBy(s => s.Name)
                            .ToList();
     ```

   - **Pagination:**
     ```csharp
     var pageSize = 10;
     var pageNumber = 1;
     var students = context.Students
                            .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)
                            .Take(pageSize)
                            .ToList();
     ```

### 9. **GroupBy Queries**  
   You can group data in EF Core similar to SQL `GROUP BY`. This is typically used for aggregations like counting, summing, or averaging grouped data.

   ```csharp
   var studentGroups = context.Students
                               .GroupBy(s => s.Age)
                               .Select(g => new { Age = g.Key, Count = g.Count() })
                               .ToList();
   ```

### 10. **Complex Queries and Subqueries**  
   EF Core allows you to build more complex queries, including subqueries. While LINQ syntax is often used for such tasks, raw SQL can also be used for more intricate queries.

   - **Subquery in LINQ:**
     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students
                            .Where(s => s.Age == (from st in context.Students
                                                  where st.Name == "John"
                                                  select st.Age).FirstOrDefault())
                            .ToList();
     ```

   - **Using Raw SQL for Subqueries:**
     ```csharp
     var students = context.Students.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age = (SELECT Age FROM Students WHERE Name = 'John')").ToList();
     ```

### Conclusion

Entity Framework Core provides powerful querying capabilities to interact with databases, including LINQ queries, raw SQL queries, eager, lazy, and explicit loading, along with projection, filtering, sorting, and pagination. By using these different query types and optimizing them based on the requirements, you can create efficient data access layers in your applications.
