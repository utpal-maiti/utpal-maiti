Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET, which allows developers to interact with databases using .NET objects. It abstracts database operations into C# objects and LINQ queries, making database interactions easier and more intuitive. However, sometimes you need more control or need to execute complex queries that EF cannot easily express in LINQ. This is where **Stored Procedures** and **Raw SQL** come into play.

### 1. **Stored Procedures in Entity Framework**

A **Stored Procedure** is a precompiled set of one or more SQL statements stored in a database that can be executed on demand. You can use stored procedures in Entity Framework in the following ways:

#### **Calling Stored Procedures in Entity Framework**
EF allows you to call stored procedures using `DbContext`'s methods. These methods can be used to map the result of the stored procedure to entity types or simple data types.

##### **Calling a Stored Procedure with No Result (Void Procedure)**
You can call a stored procedure that doesn't return any result using the `Database.ExecuteSqlRaw` method.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("EXECUTE dbo.YourStoredProcedure @param1, @param2", 
                                    new SqlParameter("@param1", value1), 
                                    new SqlParameter("@param2", value2));
}
```

Here, `ExecuteSqlRaw` executes the stored procedure but doesn't return any result.

##### **Calling a Stored Procedure with Results**
If the stored procedure returns data, you can map the result to a collection of entities or scalar types using the `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` methods.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var result = context.YourEntity.FromSqlRaw("EXECUTE dbo.YourStoredProcedure @param1", 
                                               new SqlParameter("@param1", value1)).ToList();
}
```

This will execute the stored procedure and map the returned results to a collection of `YourEntity` objects.

##### **Mapping Complex Results to Multiple Entities**
If the stored procedure returns multiple result sets or more complex data, you can use **SqlQuery** for advanced scenarios or work with `DbDataReader` directly.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var results = context.Database.SqlQuery<YourComplexEntity>("EXECUTE dbo.YourComplexProcedure").ToList();
}
```

#### **Stored Procedure with Scalar Results**
If the stored procedure returns a single scalar value, you can use `ExecuteSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` to execute it.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var result = context.Database
                        .ExecuteSqlRaw("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.YourTable");
}
```

### 2. **Raw SQL Queries in Entity Framework**

Sometimes you may need to write raw SQL queries directly, especially for performance reasons or when the query is too complex for LINQ to express easily.

#### **Querying with Raw SQL**
You can execute a raw SQL query and map the result to an entity class using `FromSqlRaw`.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var result = context.YourEntity.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM dbo.YourTable").ToList();
}
```

This query retrieves all rows from the `YourTable` and maps them to `YourEntity` objects.

#### **Using Parameterized Queries**
To prevent SQL injection, always use parameterized queries, even in raw SQL. `SqlParameter` is used to safely pass parameters into the query.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var result = context.YourEntity.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM dbo.YourTable WHERE Id = @id", 
                                                new SqlParameter("@id", 1)).ToList();
}
```

#### **Using SQL Interpolation**
Entity Framework 7 and above support **SQL Interpolation** (`FromSqlInterpolated`) which automatically handles parameterization of queries.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var result = context.YourEntity.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM dbo.YourTable WHERE Id = {id}").ToList();
}
```

This method is safer and more readable than using `ExecuteSqlRaw` or `FromSqlRaw` directly with parameters.

### 3. **Handling Complex Results (Multiple Result Sets)**

When your stored procedure returns multiple result sets, EF may not directly support it. In such cases, you might use `DbDataReader` to read the results manually.

Here is an example where you use `ExecuteReader` to manually handle the multiple result sets.

```csharp
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var connection = context.Database.GetDbConnection();
    await connection.OpenAsync();
    
    using (var command = connection.CreateCommand())
    {
        command.CommandText = "EXEC dbo.YourComplexProcedure";
        
        using (var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync())
        {
            // Read first result set
            while (await reader.ReadAsync())
            {
                var item = new YourEntity
                {
                    // Map data from reader
                };
            }
            
            // Read second result set if available
            if (await reader.NextResultAsync())
            {
                while (await reader.ReadAsync())
                {
                    var anotherItem = new AnotherEntity
                    {
                        // Map data from reader
                    };
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. **When to Use Stored Procedures and Raw SQL**

- **Stored Procedures**:
    - Use them when you need to encapsulate business logic in the database for better performance and reusability.
    - Great for batch operations, data validation, or any operation that can be complex and benefit from being executed directly on the database.
    - They help ensure consistency and security by preventing SQL injection attacks.
  
- **Raw SQL**:
    - Use raw SQL queries when you need to perform complex queries that are not easily expressed using LINQ.
    - It's also useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where LINQ or EF-generated SQL might not be efficient.
    - Be careful with raw SQL because it's less flexible and maintainable compared to using LINQ, and it opens the door for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities if parameters are not handled properly.

### Summary
- **Stored Procedures**: Useful for encapsulating complex logic and improving performance by running directly on the database.
- **Raw SQL**: Used when you need more flexibility in your queries or when EF’s LINQ doesn’t meet your needs.
- Both can be integrated seamlessly in Entity Framework using `ExecuteSqlRaw`, `FromSqlRaw`, and `FromSqlInterpolated`. Always ensure safe parameterization to avoid SQL injection risks.
