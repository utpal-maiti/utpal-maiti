In .NET Core, both `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` are interfaces that allow you to query collections of data, but they have distinct differences, especially in how and when data is retrieved and how queries are executed. Here’s a detailed explanation of each, using C#.

### 1. `IEnumerable`

**Definition:**  
`IEnumerable<T>` is an interface that represents a collection of objects that can be enumerated (iterated) one at a time. It is typically used for in-memory collections like arrays, lists, and collections that are already loaded into memory.

**Key Points:**
- **Execution Time:** `IEnumerable` queries are executed in-memory, which means that the data is retrieved immediately, and the query is executed as soon as it is iterated over. There is no deferred execution. 
- **Querying:** The LINQ operations on `IEnumerable` are executed on the client side (in-memory) and will return an `IEnumerable<T>`.
- **Performance:** Since the query is executed on the client side, `IEnumerable` may not be optimal when working with large datasets because all data must be retrieved from the data source before filtering, sorting, or transforming.

**Example:**
```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// LINQ query using IEnumerable
IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);

foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
}
```
In this example, the `Where` operation is applied to an in-memory collection (`List<int>`), and the query is executed when you iterate over `evenNumbers`.

### 2. `IQueryable`

**Definition:**  
`IQueryable<T>` is an interface that represents a collection that allows querying data from a remote data source (e.g., a database or web service) in a way that the query is not executed until you enumerate the results. It is designed for LINQ queries that need to be executed on a remote data source, such as Entity Framework.

**Key Points:**
- **Execution Time:** `IQueryable` supports deferred execution, meaning the query is not executed until you actually enumerate (iterate) over it. The query is translated into a query language (e.g., SQL for databases) when it is executed.
- **Querying:** Operations are translated to SQL (or another query language) if the source supports it. This means that `IQueryable` can be used to build more complex queries, such as SQL queries, that run on the server side.
- **Performance:** Because queries are executed on the server (such as a database), `IQueryable` is more efficient when dealing with large datasets, as the filtering, sorting, and projection happen on the database rather than in-memory.

**Example:**
```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    // IQueryable query with Entity Framework (EF)
    IQueryable<Product> products = context.Products.Where(p => p.Price > 100);

    // The query is executed when we iterate over the results.
    foreach (var product in products)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Where` operation is translated into a SQL query, which is executed on the database when the results are enumerated. This is different from `IEnumerable`, where all data is loaded into memory first.

### Key Differences Between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable`

| Feature                     | `IEnumerable<T>`                                         | `IQueryable<T>`                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**                | Immediate execution (in-memory).                       | Deferred execution (query is translated when iterated). |
| **Data Retrieval**           | Works with in-memory collections (e.g., List, Array).  | Works with data sources like databases (Entity Framework). |
| **Performance**              | Less efficient for large datasets (works on client side). | More efficient for large datasets (works on server side). |
| **Supported Operations**     | LINQ methods that operate on collections in memory.    | LINQ methods that are translated to database queries.   |
| **Examples of Use**          | In-memory collections such as lists, arrays.          | Remote data sources such as databases (Entity Framework). |
| **Use Case**                 | When you have all the data in memory and want to query it. | When querying databases or other external data sources. |

### When to Use Each
- **Use `IEnumerable`:**  
  - When working with in-memory collections like `List<T>`, `Array`, etc.
  - When you need to perform operations like filtering, sorting, or projecting on already loaded data.

- **Use `IQueryable`:**  
  - When working with remote data sources such as a database (e.g., using Entity Framework).
  - When you want to build a query that can be translated into a query language (like SQL) and executed on the data source.

### Example of Mixing Both

You can combine `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in a query. For example, you can start with an `IQueryable` to retrieve data from the database and then use `IEnumerable` operations to further filter or manipulate the data in memory:

```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    // IQueryable: Query the database
    IQueryable<Product> products = context.Products.Where(p => p.Category == "Electronics");

    // IEnumerable: Further in-memory filtering
    IEnumerable<Product> expensiveProducts = products.Where(p => p.Price > 500);

    foreach (var product in expensiveProducts)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
    }
}
```
In this case, the filtering by category is done at the database level, and the filtering by price is done in memory after the data is retrieved.

### Conclusion
- `IEnumerable<T>` is for working with in-memory data and offers immediate execution.
- `IQueryable<T>` is for working with remote data sources, offering deferred execution and the ability to translate queries into specific query languages (e.g., SQL for databases).

Choosing the right one depends on the type of data source you are working with and how you want the query to be executed.
