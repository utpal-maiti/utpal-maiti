**Global Query Filters in Entity Framework (EF) Core** are a powerful feature that allows you to automatically apply filters to all queries for a given entity. This can be useful for scenarios like multi-tenancy, soft deletes, or ensuring that only active data is returned, without needing to manually apply these filters to each query in your application code.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of **Global Query Filters** in EF Core using C#:

### 1. **What are Global Query Filters?**

Global Query Filters are filters that are automatically applied to all queries of a certain entity type (e.g., `DbSet<T>`), which means you don’t need to manually apply the same filter each time you query the database. These filters are applied at the time the query is being constructed, and you can apply them globally for all queries or selectively for specific queries.

### 2. **Setting Up Global Query Filters**

Global Query Filters are set up in the `OnModelCreating` method of your `DbContext`. You use the `modelBuilder` to configure the filter for an entity.

#### Example of a Soft Delete Scenario

Consider a scenario where you have a `Product` entity, and you want to filter out soft-deleted products from all queries without modifying every individual query.

Here’s how you can set up a global query filter to exclude soft-deleted products:

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        // Global Query Filter to exclude products marked as deleted
        modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().HasQueryFilter(p => !p.IsDeleted);
    }
}

public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }  // Soft delete flag
}
```

In the above example:
- `HasQueryFilter(p => !p.IsDeleted)` ensures that the `IsDeleted` field is checked automatically in all queries involving the `Product` entity.
- The filter excludes any product where `IsDeleted` is `true`.

### 3. **When is the Filter Applied?**

- The filter is applied **whenever you query the `DbSet<T>`** (in this case, `Products`). For instance:
  ```csharp
  var products = dbContext.Products.ToList();
  ```
  This query will automatically exclude products where `IsDeleted` is `true` due to the global query filter.
  
- The global filter is applied to **all LINQ queries** (including those using `ToList()`, `FirstOrDefault()`, `Count()`, etc.) and raw SQL queries if they use the EF Core's query translation.

### 4. **Disabling Global Query Filters**

Sometimes, you might need to explicitly include items that would normally be excluded by a global query filter (like soft-deleted records). You can temporarily disable the global query filter by using the `IgnoreQueryFilters()` method:

```csharp
// Query including soft-deleted products
var deletedProducts = dbContext.Products.IgnoreQueryFilters().Where(p => p.IsDeleted).ToList();
```

- `IgnoreQueryFilters()` disables any global query filters for that specific query. In this case, it allows you to retrieve products even if they are marked as deleted.

### 5. **Multiple Filters and Complex Scenarios**

You can also use **complex expressions** or **multiple filters** in global query filters. For example, you may want to exclude soft-deleted products **only for a specific tenant** (multi-tenancy). You can apply such logic by combining multiple conditions:

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        // Apply global query filter for multi-tenancy and soft delete
        modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().HasQueryFilter(p => !p.IsDeleted && p.TenantId == currentTenantId);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Product` filter checks two conditions: it ensures that the product is not soft-deleted and that it belongs to the current tenant (using a `TenantId`).

### 6. **Global Query Filters and Inheritance**

If you are using **inheritance** with `TPT` (Table-per-Type), `TPC` (Table-per-Concrete Class), or `TPH` (Table-per-Hierarchy) strategies, you can apply global filters on the base class, and they will automatically apply to the derived classes as well.

#### Example of Inheritance with Global Query Filters:

```csharp
public class BaseEntity
{
    public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
}

public class Product : BaseEntity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Order : BaseEntity
{
    public string OrderNumber { get; set; }
}

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        // Apply global filter on base class, which affects all derived classes
        modelBuilder.Entity<BaseEntity>().HasQueryFilter(e => !e.IsDeleted);
    }
}
```

### 7. **Limitations of Global Query Filters**
- **Doesn't work with explicit `IQueryable` methods**: If you use raw SQL queries or manual `IQueryable` expressions, you may need to apply filters manually or use `IgnoreQueryFilters()`.
- **Performance consideration**: Global filters apply to all queries, so if you use them on very large datasets with complex conditions, it could affect performance.
- **Cannot modify after query execution**: Global filters are applied at the point of query construction and cannot be dynamically adjusted during query execution.

### 8. **Summary**

Global Query Filters in EF Core allow you to centralize and automate filtering logic for entities, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain. Whether you're using soft deletes, multi-tenancy, or any other global filtering logic, EF Core’s support for these filters ensures that your data access logic remains DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

### Use Cases for Global Query Filters:
1. **Soft Deletes**: Automatically exclude records marked as deleted.
2. **Multi-Tenancy**: Automatically filter data based on the current tenant.
3. **Archiving**: Automatically exclude archived records.
4. **Date Ranges**: Automatically filter based on start and end dates for events or data validity.

Global Query Filters in EF Core provide a powerful, reusable way to manage query filters without manually adding them to every query, ensuring consistency across your data access code.
