The **Code First Approach** in Entity Framework (EF) is a technique for defining and managing a database using code. In this approach, the classes in your application (typically POCOs—Plain Old CLR Objects) represent the entities in the database, and EF will generate the database schema based on these classes. This is in contrast to the **Database First** approach where the database schema is defined first, and EF generates the classes to match the schema.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the **Code First Approach** using C#:

### 1. **Creating Entity Classes**
In the **Code First Approach**, you start by creating C# classes that will map to the database tables. Each class corresponds to a table in the database, and the properties of the class represent columns in that table.

For example, let's create a simple `Student` class:

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- `StudentId` will be the primary key of the `Student` table.
- `Name` and `Age` are additional columns.

### 2. **Defining the DbContext**
Next, you create a class that inherits from `DbContext`. The `DbContext` class represents a session with the database and provides methods for querying and saving data. The `DbContext` includes `DbSet<T>` properties that represent the tables in the database.

Here’s an example:

```csharp
using System.Data.Entity;

public class SchoolContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

- `DbSet<Student>` corresponds to the `Students` table in the database.
- The `SchoolContext` class will be used for querying and interacting with the `Student` table.

### 3. **Configuring the Database**
You can configure the database connection string in the `App.config` or `Web.config` file. EF will use this connection string to connect to the database.

Example `App.config`:

```xml
<configuration>
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="SchoolContext" 
         connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=SchoolDB;Integrated Security=True" 
         providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
  </connectionStrings>
</configuration>
```

### 4. **Migrations**
One of the key features of the Code First approach is the ability to use **Migrations** to evolve the database schema as your model changes over time.

#### Enabling Migrations:
You need to enable migrations for the project. You can do this using the **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio.

```bash
Enable-Migrations
```

This will create a `Migrations` folder in your project.

#### Adding a Migration:
After defining or changing the entity classes, you can generate a migration to update the database schema. For example:

```bash
Add-Migration InitialCreate
```

This will create a migration class in the `Migrations` folder. The migration class will include code for creating the database schema (tables, columns, etc.).

#### Applying Migrations:
To apply the migration and update the database, use:

```bash
Update-Database
```

This will execute the migration and apply the changes to the actual database.

#### Example Migration Class:
Here’s an example of what the generated migration might look like:

```csharp
public partial class InitialCreate : DbMigration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        CreateTable(
            "dbo.Students",
            c => new
                {
                    StudentId = c.Int(nullable: false, identity: true),
                    Name = c.String(),
                    Age = c.Int(nullable: false),
                })
            .PrimaryKey(t => t.StudentId);
    }
    
    public override void Down()
    {
        DropTable("dbo.Students");
    }
}
```

### 5. **Data Seeding**
You can also seed initial data into the database using the **Seed method** in the `Configuration` class. This method is executed when applying the migration for the first time.

Example:

```csharp
internal sealed class Configuration : DbMigrationsConfiguration<SchoolContext>
{
    public Configuration()
    {
        AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false;
    }

    protected override void Seed(SchoolContext context)
    {
        context.Students.AddOrUpdate(
            s => s.StudentId, // Primary key
            new Student { Name = "John Doe", Age = 18 },
            new Student { Name = "Jane Smith", Age = 22 }
        );
    }
}
```

### 6. **Performing CRUD Operations**
Once the database is created, you can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the `DbContext` class.

#### Create:
```csharp
using (var context = new SchoolContext())
{
    var student = new Student { Name = "Sam Lee", Age = 20 };
    context.Students.Add(student);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

#### Read:
```csharp
using (var context = new SchoolContext())
{
    var students = context.Students.ToList();
}
```

#### Update:
```csharp
using (var context = new SchoolContext())
{
    var student = context.Students.First();
    student.Name = "Updated Name";
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

#### Delete:
```csharp
using (var context = new SchoolContext())
{
    var student = context.Students.First();
    context.Students.Remove(student);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

### 7. **Code First Data Annotations and Fluent API**
You can control the database schema by using **data annotations** and the **Fluent API**.

#### Data Annotations:
Data annotations are attributes that can be applied to model properties and classes to define relationships, constraints, and more.

Example of using data annotations:

```csharp
public class Student
{
    [Key] // Marks this property as the primary key
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    
    [Required] // Marks this property as required
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    [Range(18, 100)] // Marks this property with a range constraint
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

#### Fluent API:
The Fluent API is a more flexible way to configure the model. You typically use it in the `OnModelCreating` method of the `DbContext` class.

Example of using Fluent API:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
        .Property(s => s.Name)
        .IsRequired()
        .HasMaxLength(100);
}
```

### 8. **Advantages of Code First**
- **Database-agnostic**: Code First allows you to switch between different databases without changing the model.
- **Automatic database creation**: You can generate a database from your model using migrations.
- **Easier to manage changes**: With migrations, it's easy to update the schema as your application evolves.

### 9. **Disadvantages of Code First**
- **Lack of fine-grained control**: While the Fluent API and migrations give you flexibility, it may not provide the same level of control over the database schema as Database First.
- **Initial setup complexity**: Setting up and configuring migrations can be complex in some scenarios.

### Conclusion
The **Code First** approach in Entity Framework allows you to build a database from your code model, and through migrations, it provides a powerful way to evolve and maintain your database schema over time. This is especially useful in scenarios where the application code and database are tightly coupled and evolve together.
