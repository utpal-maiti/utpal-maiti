Concurrency control in Entity Framework (EF) is a mechanism to manage the simultaneous execution of transactions to ensure data integrity. In EF, concurrency control typically involves ensuring that multiple users or processes don't conflict when accessing and modifying data in a database.

### Types of Concurrency in Entity Framework:

1. **Optimistic Concurrency**: Assumes that conflicts between transactions are rare. The transaction works under the assumption that no other process will modify the same data, and it checks for conflicts only at the time of saving changes.
   
2. **Pessimistic Concurrency**: Locks the data when it is being accessed so that other transactions cannot modify it until the current transaction is completed. This is not natively supported in EF Core but can be implemented using database locking mechanisms.

### Concurrency Control in Entity Framework (EF):

#### 1. **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**

EF Core uses **optimistic concurrency control** by default, where it allows multiple transactions to work on the same data concurrently, but conflicts are checked when saving the changes. If there is a conflict (i.e., another transaction modifies the data before your transaction completes), a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is thrown.

##### Example of Optimistic Concurrency:

1. **Add a Concurrency Token**: To use optimistic concurrency, a property must be marked as a **Concurrency Token** (usually a `timestamp` or `rowversion` field).

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    // Rowversion column (Concurrency Token)
    [Timestamp]
    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }
}
```

Here, the `RowVersion` property is marked with the `[Timestamp]` attribute, making it a concurrency token.

2. **Handling Concurrency Conflicts**: When updating or deleting a record, EF will check the `RowVersion` column in the database to ensure that no other transaction has modified the record since it was read.

```csharp
using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
{
    var product = context.Products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.ProductId == 1);

    // Modify the product's properties
    product.Price = 19.99m;

    try
    {
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
    catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException ex)
    {
        foreach (var entry in ex.Entries)
        {
            // Handle the concurrency conflict (e.g., reload the entity, prompt user, etc.)
            if (entry.Entity is Product)
            {
                var databaseEntity = entry.GetDatabaseValues();
                // Decide on how to resolve the conflict, for instance, reload the entity
                entry.OriginalValues.SetValues(databaseEntity);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, if a conflict occurs (i.e., the `RowVersion` does not match the database value), a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is thrown. You can then handle the conflict by choosing to reload the entity from the database or merging changes.

#### 2. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

Although EF doesn't directly support **pessimistic concurrency** (locking), you can implement it using explicit locking in SQL. For example, you can use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` in raw SQL queries to lock the data when it's being read.

```csharp
using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
{
    var product = context.Products
        .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WITH (UPDLOCK) WHERE ProductId = {0}", 1)
        .FirstOrDefault();
    
    // Modify the product's properties
    product.Price = 19.99m;

    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

In this example, `WITH (UPDLOCK)` is a SQL hint that acquires an update lock, preventing other transactions from modifying the data until the current transaction is complete.

#### 3. **Concurrency Control with EF Core 7.0 and Later (Stored Procedures)**

EF Core 7 introduced more advanced concurrency features such as **stored procedures** and custom `SQLCommand` execution to handle concurrency in scenarios where the application needs complex conflict resolution.

#### 4. **Concurrency Conflict Handling Strategies**

- **Client Wins**: If a conflict occurs, the client-side changes overwrite the changes made by others.
  
- **Store Wins**: If a conflict occurs, the changes in the database are accepted, and the client's changes are discarded.

- **Merge**: The client and store changes are merged together. This approach requires custom logic and can be complex.

You can implement these strategies by modifying the `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` handling logic.

#### 5. **Explicit Concurrency in EF Core**

Sometimes, you might want to manually manage concurrency. EF Core allows you to explicitly control concurrency by using the `RowVersion` or `Timestamp` columns in SQL. The typical process involves reading the data, modifying it, and using `SaveChanges()` to handle any conflicts.

### Summary of Concurrency Control in Entity Framework:

- **Optimistic Concurrency** is the default strategy, using a concurrency token like `RowVersion` or `Timestamp` to detect conflicts when saving changes.
- **Pessimistic Concurrency** can be implemented via explicit locking using raw SQL queries (e.g., `SELECT FOR UPDATE`).
- **Concurrency conflicts** are handled by catching `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` and resolving the conflict based on custom logic.
