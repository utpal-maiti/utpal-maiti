    ```

4. **Docker Run**: Running a container from an image
    ```sh
    docker run [image_name]
    ```
    E.g.,

5. **Listing Docker Images**: View all downloaded images
    ```sh
    docker images
    ```

6. **Listing Docker Containers**: View all running containers
    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```
    - For both running and stopped containers:
    ```sh

    ```

7. **Docker Stop**: Stopping a running container
    ```sh
    docker stop [container_id]
    ```

8. **Docker Remove Container**: Removing a stopped container
    ```sh
    docker rm [container_id]
    ```

9. **Docker Remove Image**: Removing an image
    ```sh
    docker rmi [image_name]
    ```

10. **Docker Compose**: Running multi-container Docker applications
    - Navigate to your project directory and use:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up

11. **Docker Build**: Building an image from a Dockerfile
    ```sh
    docker build -t [your_image_name] .
