### Temporary Tables in SQL Server

Temporary tables in SQL Server are used to store intermediate results temporarily. These tables are particularly useful when dealing with large or complex queries, as they allow you to simplify query logic and optimize performance.

### Types of Temporary Tables

1. **Local Temporary Tables (`#TableName`)**
   - Scope: Session-specific. Only available to the connection that created them.
   - Automatically dropped when the session ends or the connection is closed.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
         ID INT,
         Name NVARCHAR(50)
     );

     INSERT INTO #TempTable VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

     SELECT * FROM #TempTable;
     ```

2. **Global Temporary Tables (`##TableName`)**
   - Scope: Accessible across all sessions.
   - Automatically dropped when the session that created it is closed and no other session is referencing it.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (
         ID INT,
         Name NVARCHAR(50)
     );

     INSERT INTO ##GlobalTempTable VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

     SELECT * FROM ##GlobalTempTable;
     ```

3. **Table Variables (`@TableName`)**
   - Scope: Declared and used within a batch or stored procedure.
   - Automatically dropped when the batch or procedure ends.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     DECLARE @TableVar TABLE (
         ID INT,
         Name NVARCHAR(50)
     );

     INSERT INTO @TableVar VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

     SELECT * FROM @TableVar;
     ```

4. **Derived Tables**
   - Scope: Only available within the query where they are defined.
   - Created using a subquery or `WITH` clause.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     WITH TempCTE AS (
         SELECT ID, Name
         FROM Employees
         WHERE Department = 'Sales'
     )
     SELECT * FROM TempCTE;
     ```

### Benefits of Temporary Tables
- **Intermediate Data Storage:** Simplify complex queries by storing intermediate results.
- **Isolation:** Local temporary tables ensure data is isolated between sessions.
- **Performance:** Can improve performance by avoiding redundant computation or repetitive query execution.

### Common Use Cases
1. **Storing Results of Complex Queries:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ID, Name, Salary
   INTO #TempResults
   FROM Employees
   WHERE Department = 'Finance';

   SELECT * FROM #TempResults WHERE Salary > 50000;
   ```

2. **Breaking Down Complex Business Logic:**
   - Temporary tables allow breaking down long queries into smaller, more manageable steps.

3. **Joining Temporary Results with Permanent Tables:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE #SalesSummary (
       ProductID INT,
       TotalSales INT
   );

   INSERT INTO #SalesSummary
   SELECT ProductID, SUM(Quantity)
   FROM Sales
   GROUP BY ProductID;

   SELECT P.Name, S.TotalSales
   FROM Products P
   INNER JOIN #SalesSummary S ON P.ID = S.ProductID;
   ```

### Best Practices
1. **Avoid Overusing Global Temporary Tables:** Use them only when data needs to be shared across sessions.
2. **Optimize Indexing:** Add indexes to temporary tables for better performance when querying large datasets.
3. **Cleanup:** Explicitly drop temporary tables if no longer needed to release resources.
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE #TempTable;
   ```
4. **Use Temporary Tables Over Cursors:** When processing large datasets, temporary tables are usually more efficient than cursors.

### Limitations
1. **No Foreign Keys:** Temporary tables do not support foreign key constraints.
2. **Limited by TempDB:** Temporary tables are stored in the `tempdb` system database, so their performance and size depend on `tempdb` configuration.
3. **Concurrency:** Using temporary tables in high-concurrency scenarios may lead to contention in `tempdb`.

Understanding the appropriate use cases and limitations of temporary tables can significantly enhance query performance and maintainability in SQL Server.
