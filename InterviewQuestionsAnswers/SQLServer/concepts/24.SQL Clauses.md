SQL clauses are the building blocks of SQL queries that help you define and manipulate data within a database. Below is a detailed overview of commonly used SQL clauses, with examples specific to **SQL Server**.

---

### 1. **SELECT Clause**
The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from a table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees;
```
Here, only the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns are retrieved from the `Employees` table.

---

### 2. **FROM Clause**
The `FROM` clause specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve the data.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders;
```
This retrieves all columns from the `Orders` table.

---

### 3. **WHERE Clause**
The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on specific conditions.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 50;
```
This retrieves products with a price greater than 50.

---

### 4. **GROUP BY Clause**
The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows sharing a common value into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT CategoryID, COUNT(*) AS ProductCount
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
```
This counts the number of products in each category.

---

### 5. **HAVING Clause**
The `HAVING` clause filters aggregated data after `GROUP BY`.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT CategoryID, COUNT(*) AS ProductCount
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
This retrieves only those categories with more than five products.

---

### 6. **ORDER BY Clause**
The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```
This sorts the products by price in descending order.

---

### 7. **JOIN Clause**
The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

**Types of Joins:**
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN:** Returns rows when there is a match in either table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

---

### 8. **UNION Clause**
The `UNION` clause combines results from multiple `SELECT` statements, removing duplicates by default.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers;
```
This retrieves a distinct list of cities from both `Customers` and `Suppliers`.

---

### 9. **LIMIT Clause (TOP in SQL Server)**
In SQL Server, use `TOP` to limit the number of rows returned.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 * 
FROM Products;
```
This retrieves the top 5 rows from the `Products` table.

---

### 10. **INSERT INTO Clause**
The `INSERT INTO` clause is used to add new rows to a table.

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, JobTitle)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Manager');
```

---

### 11. **UPDATE Clause**
The `UPDATE` clause modifies existing records in a table.

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET JobTitle = 'Senior Manager'
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

---

### 12. **DELETE Clause**
The `DELETE` clause removes rows from a table.

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

---

### 13. **CASE Statement**
The `CASE` statement is used to add conditional logic within queries.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, 
       CASE 
           WHEN Price > 100 THEN 'Expensive'
           WHEN Price BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN 'Moderate'
           ELSE 'Cheap'
       END AS PriceCategory
FROM Products;
```

---

### 14. **DISTINCT Clause**
The `DISTINCT` clause removes duplicate rows from the result set.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country
FROM Customers;
```

---

### 15. **EXISTS Clause**
The `EXISTS` clause checks for the existence of rows in a subquery.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT CustomerName
FROM Customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
);
```

---

### 16. **SUBQUERIES**
Subqueries are queries nested inside other queries.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
```

---

### 17. **OVER Clause**
The `OVER` clause is used with window functions to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Salary, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM Employees;
```

---

These are fundamental clauses and concepts in SQL Server that help you manipulate and retrieve data effectively.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the SQL concepts you mentioned, specifically in the context of SQL Server:

### 1. **`EXCEPT`**
   - The `EXCEPT` operator is used to return the distinct rows from the first query that are not present in the second query. 
   - It works like the subtraction of two result sets.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   EXCEPT
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table2;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName
   FROM Employees
   EXCEPT
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName
   FROM FormerEmployees;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - The columns must be of the same type and in the same order.
   - `EXCEPT` removes duplicate rows, meaning it performs a `DISTINCT` operation.

### 2. **`ALL`**
   - The `ALL` keyword is used in conjunction with operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `<>`. It returns true if the condition is true for **all** the rows in the subquery result.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table
   WHERE column_name operator ALL (SELECT column_name FROM another_table);
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductName
   FROM Products
   WHERE Price > ALL (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Electronics');
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - `ALL` compares a value to all the values in the subquery.
   - It works in a way where the condition must hold for every row returned by the subquery.

### 3. **`ANY`**
   - The `ANY` keyword is used in a similar way to `ALL`, but it returns true if the condition is true for **any** of the rows in the subquery result.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table
   WHERE column_name operator ANY (SELECT column_name FROM another_table);
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductName
   FROM Products
   WHERE Price > ANY (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Electronics');
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - `ANY` allows for a condition to be true if it matches any one of the rows in the subquery result.
   - It can be used with operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `<>`.

### 4. **`UNION`**
   - The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. It removes duplicate rows from the final result set.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   UNION
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table2;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName
   FROM Employees
   UNION
   SELECT FirstName, LastName
   FROM FormerEmployees;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - All `SELECT` queries involved must return the same number of columns, with similar data types.
   - If you need to include duplicates, use `UNION ALL`.

### 5. **`UNION ALL`**
   - The `UNION ALL` operator combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements without removing duplicates.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   UNION ALL
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table2;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName
   FROM Employees
   UNION ALL
   SELECT FirstName, LastName
   FROM FormerEmployees;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicate rows, so it can be faster than `UNION` because it does not have to perform a `DISTINCT` operation.

### 6. **`INTERSECT`**
   - The `INTERSECT` operator returns the distinct rows that are common between two `SELECT` statements.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   INTERSECT
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table2;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName
   FROM Employees
   INTERSECT
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName
   FROM Contractors;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - `INTERSECT` removes duplicates and returns only the rows that are common to both queries.
   - The columns must be of the same type and in the same order.

### 7. **`BETWEEN`**
   - The `BETWEEN` operator is used to filter the result set within a range. It is inclusive, meaning the boundaries are included in the result.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table
   WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductName, Price
   FROM Products
   WHERE Price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - It can be used for numbers, dates, and text (alphabetical order).
   - The range is inclusive, so both `value1` and `value2` are considered in the result.

### 8. **`CASE`**
   - The `CASE` expression is used to create conditional logic within a query. It’s similar to an `IF-ELSE` structure.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name,
          CASE
             WHEN condition1 THEN result1
             WHEN condition2 THEN result2
             ELSE result3
          END AS new_column
   FROM table;
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductName, 
          CASE 
              WHEN Price > 100 THEN 'Expensive'
              WHEN Price BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN 'Moderate'
              ELSE 'Cheap'
          END AS PriceCategory
   FROM Products;
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - `CASE` can be used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` statements.
   - There are two types: **Simple CASE** (based on equality comparison) and **Searched CASE** (based on conditions).

Each of these operators and concepts plays a critical role in querying and manipulating data in SQL Server. They help refine the queries, making them more flexible and powerful for various data retrieval needs.
