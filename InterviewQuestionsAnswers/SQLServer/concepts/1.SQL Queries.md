Sure, let's dive into the concepts of SQL queries in detail using SQL Server. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows you to perform various operations on the data stored in SQL Server. Here are the key concepts and examples:

### 1. **SELECT Statement**
The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
**Detailed Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```

### 2. **INSERT Statement**
The `INSERT` statement is used to add new rows of data to a table.

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```
**Detailed Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email, Department)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'Sales');
```

### 3. **UPDATE Statement**
The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing data in a table.

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```
**Detailed Example:**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Email = 'john.doe@newdomain.com'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

### 4. **DELETE Statement**
The `DELETE` statement is used to remove rows from a table.

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
**Detailed Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

### 5. **JOINs**
JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The most common types are `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.

**Example of INNER JOIN:**
```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM tableA A
INNER JOIN tableB B
ON A.common_field = B.common_field;
```
**Detailed Example:**
```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
```

### 6. **Aggregate Functions**
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Salary), MIN(Salary), MAX(Salary)
FROM Employees;
```

### 7. **GROUP BY Statement**
The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*), AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

### 8. **HAVING Clause**
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on a condition, similar to the `WHERE` clause but for groups.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*), AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
```

### 9. **ORDER BY Clause**
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

### 10. **Subqueries**
Subqueries are nested queries that are used to perform an operation based on the result of another query.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales');
```

### 11. **Views**
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It can encapsulate complex queries and simplify data access.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW SalesEmployees AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```
**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM SalesEmployees;
```

### 12. **Stored Procedures**
Stored procedures are precompiled collections of SQL statements that are stored under a name and processed as a unit.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email, Department
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;
```
**Usage:**
```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @EmployeeID = 1;
```

### 13. **Triggers**
Triggers are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute when an event occurs in the database, such as an insert, update, or delete operation.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER EmployeeInsertTrigger
ON Employees
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, ActionDate)
    VALUES ('New employee added', GETDATE());
END;
```

### Summary

SQL Server provides a rich set of features and SQL commands for managing data effectively. Understanding these concepts and how to use them allows you to interact with and manipulate data efficiently within a SQL Server database.
