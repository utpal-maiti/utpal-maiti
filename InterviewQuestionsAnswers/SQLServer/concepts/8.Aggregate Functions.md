Aggregate functions in SQL Server are powerful tools that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. Let's explore the key aggregate functions available in SQL Server and how to use them with detailed examples.

### Key Aggregate Functions

1. **COUNT()**
2. **SUM()**
3. **AVG()**
4. **MIN()**
5. **MAX()**

### 1. COUNT()

The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Employees;
```
This query returns the total number of rows in the `Employees` table.

**Example with Condition:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```
This query returns the number of employees in the 'Sales' department.

### 2. SUM()

The `SUM()` function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(Salary)
FROM Employees;
```
This query returns the total sum of salaries in the `Employees` table.

**Example with Condition:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
```
This query returns the total sum of salaries for employees in the 'Engineering' department.

### 3. AVG()

The `AVG()` function returns the average value of a numeric column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees;
```
This query returns the average salary in the `Employees` table.

**Example with Condition:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR';
```
This query returns the average salary for employees in the 'HR' department.

### 4. MIN()

The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value in a column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary)
FROM Employees;
```
This query returns the smallest salary in the `Employees` table.

**Example with Condition:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Finance';
```
This query returns the smallest salary for employees in the 'Finance' department.

### 5. MAX()

The `MAX()` function returns the largest value in a column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM Employees;
```
This query returns the largest salary in the `Employees` table.

**Example with Condition:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Marketing';
```
This query returns the largest salary for employees in the 'Marketing' department.

### Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY

Aggregate functions are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

**Example: Grouping and Aggregating**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*), AVG(Salary), SUM(Salary), MIN(Salary), MAX(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```
This query returns the count, average salary, total salary, minimum salary, and maximum salary for each department.

### Using Aggregate Functions with HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on a condition, similar to the `WHERE` clause but for groups.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
```
This query returns the departments where the average salary is greater than 50,000.

### Summary

Aggregate functions in SQL Server are essential for performing calculations on sets of values and summarizing data. By using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`, you can derive meaningful insights from your data. When combined with the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses, aggregate functions provide powerful tools for data analysis and reporting.
