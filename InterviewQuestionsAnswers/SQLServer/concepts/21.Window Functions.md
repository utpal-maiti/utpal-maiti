Window functions in SQL Server are powerful tools for performing calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, which group multiple rows into a single output row, window functions allow for row-level granularity with aggregated or computed values based on an overall dataset. They are often used in analytics, reporting, and data transformation tasks.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Window Definition**  
   A "window" defines a subset of rows within a dataset over which the function is applied. The window is specified using the `OVER` clause. The `OVER` clause can include:
   - **Partitioning**: Groups rows into partitions.
   - **Ordering**: Determines the order of rows within a partition.
   - **Framing**: Defines a subset of rows within a partition for computation.

2. **Types of Window Functions**
   - **Aggregate Window Functions**: Perform aggregations like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`.
   - **Ranking Functions**: Provide rankings like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `NTILE()`.
   - **Value Functions**: Access specific row values such as `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, `LEAD`, `LAG`.
   - **Statistical Functions**: Perform statistical operations, e.g., `PERCENT_RANK`, `CUME_DIST`.

---

### **Basic Syntax**
```sql
<function>() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY <partition_columns>] 
    [ORDER BY <order_columns>] 
    [ROWS | RANGE BETWEEN <frame_start> AND <frame_end>]
)
```

- **`PARTITION BY`**: Divides the dataset into partitions. Computation is performed separately within each partition.
- **`ORDER BY`**: Specifies the order of rows within each partition.
- **Framing (Optional)**: Further restricts the rows within a partition used for computation.

### **Examples of Window Functions**

#### 1. **Aggregate Window Functions**
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DepartmentID, 
    Salary, 
    SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS TotalDepartmentSalary
FROM Employees;
```
- **Purpose**: Calculates the total salary for each department without collapsing rows.

---

#### 2. **Ranking Functions**
- **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Assigns a unique number to each row based on the specified order.
- **`RANK()`**: Assigns a rank, leaving gaps for tied values.
- **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Assigns a rank without leaving gaps.
- **`NTILE(n)`**: Distributes rows into `n` groups.

Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DepartmentID, 
    Salary, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNumber,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employees;
```

---

#### 3. **Value Functions**
- **`LEAD()`**: Accesses data from the next row in the dataset.
- **`LAG()`**: Accesses data from the previous row in the dataset.
- **`FIRST_VALUE()` / `LAST_VALUE()`**: Retrieves the first/last value of a window.

Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DepartmentID, 
    Salary, 
    LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary) AS PreviousSalary,
    LEAD(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees;
```

---

#### 4. **Statistical Functions**
- **`PERCENT_RANK()`**: Calculates the relative rank of a row as a percentage of the total rows.
- **`CUME_DIST()`**: Calculates the cumulative distribution of a value within a partition.

Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DepartmentID, 
    Salary, 
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary) AS PercentRank,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary) AS CumulativeDistribution
FROM Employees;
```

---

### **Framing with ROWS or RANGE**
- **ROWS**: Refers to a physical number of rows.
- **RANGE**: Refers to logical rows based on value ranges.

Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DepartmentID, 
    Salary, 
    SUM(Salary) OVER (
        PARTITION BY DepartmentID 
        ORDER BY Salary 
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
    ) AS MovingSum
FROM Employees;
```

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Running Totals**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       EmployeeID, 
       Salary, 
       SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningTotal
   FROM Employees;
   ```

2. **Top-N Analysis**:
   ```sql
   WITH RankedEmployees AS (
       SELECT 
           EmployeeID, 
           Salary, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
       FROM Employees
   )
   SELECT * 
   FROM RankedEmployees
   WHERE Rank <= 3;
   ```

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       EmployeeID, 
       Salary, 
       LAG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS PreviousSalary,
       Salary - LAG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS SalaryDifference
   FROM Employees;
   ```

### **Best Practices**
- Use `PARTITION BY` judiciously to prevent unnecessary performance overhead.
- Ensure proper indexing on columns used in `ORDER BY` for better performance.
- Avoid overuse of complex windowing operations in very large datasets without optimization.
