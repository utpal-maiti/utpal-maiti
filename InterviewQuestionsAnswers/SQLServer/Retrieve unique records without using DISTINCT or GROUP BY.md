To retrieve unique records without using `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY`, you can use alternative methods like **window functions** or **subqueries** to filter out duplicate rows. Here are some approaches:

---

### 1. **Using `ROW_NUMBER()`**

The `ROW_NUMBER()` function can assign a unique rank to rows, and you can filter out duplicates by choosing the first occurrence.

```sql
WITH RankedRows AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2, column3 ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNum
    FROM TableName
)
SELECT *
FROM RankedRows
WHERE RowNum = 1;
```

**Explanation**:

- `PARTITION BY column1, column2, column3`: Groups rows with the same values in the specified columns.
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique number to each row within a group.
- `RowNum = 1`: Filters the first row from each group, effectively removing duplicates.

### 2. **Using `EXISTS`**

You can use a correlated subquery to ensure only unique records are included.

```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM TableName t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM TableName t2
    WHERE t2.column1 = t1.column1
      AND t2.column2 = t1.column2
      AND t2.column3 = t1.column3
      AND t2.ID < t1.ID
);
```

**Explanation**:

- For each row in the table (`t1`), the subquery checks if there is an earlier row (`t2`) with the same values in the specified columns (`column1`, `column2`, `column3`).
- If no such earlier row exists, the record is unique and is included in the output.

### 3. **Using a Temporary Table**

You can insert unique rows into a temporary table with a primary key constraint.

```sql
-- Create a temporary table with a unique constraint
CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
    column1 DataType,
    column2 DataType,
    column3 DataType,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Unique PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2, column3)
);

-- Insert rows into the temporary table
INSERT INTO #TempTable (column1, column2, column3)
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM TableName;

-- Retrieve unique rows
SELECT *
FROM #TempTable;

-- Drop the temporary table
DROP TABLE #TempTable;
```

**Explanation**:

- The primary key constraint ensures only unique rows are inserted into the temporary table.

---

### 4. **Using `UNION ALL`**

If you have a way to split the data into smaller subsets (e.g., based on conditions), you can combine subsets and implicitly remove duplicates.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM TableName t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM TableName t2
    WHERE t2.column1 = t1.column1
      AND t2.column2 = t1.column2
      AND t2.column3 = t1.column3
      AND t2.ID < t1.ID
)
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM TableName WHERE some_condition;
```

---

### 5. **Using Self-JOIN**

You can perform a self-join to identify unique rows based on your criteria.

```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM TableName t1
LEFT JOIN TableName t2
ON t1.column1 = t2.column1
   AND t1.column2 = t2.column2
   AND t1.column3 = t2.column3
   AND t1.ID > t2.ID
WHERE t2.ID IS NULL;
```

**Explanation**:

- The `LEFT JOIN` pairs rows in `t1` with duplicates in `t2`.
- The condition `t2.ID IS NULL` ensures only unique rows are included in the result.

### Choosing the Best Approach

- Use `ROW_NUMBER()` for ease and efficiency if window functions are supported.
- Use `EXISTS` for clarity and when working with smaller datasets.
- Use temporary tables if you need to enforce constraints programmatically.
