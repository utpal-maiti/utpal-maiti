When it comes to the `COUNT` function in SQL, you might often see variations such as `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(5)`. However, there are key differences:

### `COUNT(*)`
- **Functionality**: `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the result set, including those with NULL values.
- **Common Usage**: It's the most frequently used form to get the total number of rows in a table or a result set.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Employees;
  ```

### `COUNT(5)`
- **Functionality**: Using `COUNT(5)` or any other constant value counts the number of rows where the value of that constant is considered (similar to `COUNT(1)`).
- **Performance**: There's no performance difference between `COUNT(5)`, `COUNT(1)`, or `COUNT(*)` because SQL Server and most databases optimize them to execute similarly.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(5)
  FROM Employees;
  ```

### Which One to Use?
- **Best Practice**: Stick with `COUNT(*)`. It's more readable and expresses your intent clearly.
  
The choice of `COUNT(*)` vs. `COUNT(5)` doesn't significantly impact performance, but `COUNT(*)` is the conventional and more understandable way of counting rows.

Sure! Here's an example of using `COUNT(5)` in a SQL query. 

Let's say you have a table called `Employees` and you want to count the number of rows in the table. You can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(5)
FROM Employees;
```

This query will return the total number of rows in the `Employees` table. The number `5` is arbitrary and does not affect the result. You could replace it with any constant value (e.g., `COUNT(1)` or `COUNT('any constant')`), and the result would be the same.

However, it's more common to see `COUNT(*)` used for clarity and convention, as it more clearly indicates that you're counting all rows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Employees;
```

Both queries will yield the same result.
