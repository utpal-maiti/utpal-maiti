The `SKIP` and `TAKE` clauses are used in SQL to implement paging, commonly to retrieve a subset of rows from a query result, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets. 

Hereâ€™s an example using SQL Server's `OFFSET` and `FETCH` to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY id
OFFSET 10 ROWS         -- Skip first 10 rows
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;  -- Take the next 10 rows
```

In this example, the query skips the first 10 rows and then fetches the next 10 rows from the `Employees` table.

For databases that do not support `OFFSET` and `FETCH`, like older versions of SQL Server, you can use a `ROW_NUMBER()` approach:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS row_num
    FROM Employees
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE
WHERE row_num > 10 AND row_num <= 20;  -- Skip first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows
```

In this query, we use a common table expression (CTE) to assign row numbers to each row, then filter based on the row numbers.
