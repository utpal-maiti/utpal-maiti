Certainly! Here are some scenario-based interview questions related to ADO.NET using C#:

### 1. Handling Database Connections Efficiently
**Scenario:**
You have a high-traffic web application that frequently accesses a SQL Server database. How would you efficiently manage database connections to ensure optimal performance?

**Answer:**
   - Use connection pooling to reuse database connections.
   - Open connections as late as possible and close them as soon as possible.
   - Use the `using` statement to ensure connections are properly disposed.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
   {
       connection.Open();
       // Perform database operations
   } // Connection is automatically closed and disposed here
   ```

### 2. Protecting Against SQL Injection
**Scenario:**
You need to implement a search feature that allows users to search for customers by their name. How would you prevent SQL injection attacks in your implementation?

**Answer:**
   - Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.
   - Use the `SqlParameter` class to add parameters to your `SqlCommand`.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName = @CustomerName", connection))
   {
       command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@CustomerName", customerName);
       using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
       {
           while (reader.Read())
           {
               Console.WriteLine(reader["CustomerName"]);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. Implementing Transactions
**Scenario:**
You need to ensure that two related database operations either both succeed or both fail. How would you implement this using transactions in ADO.NET?

**Answer:**
   - Use the `SqlTransaction` class to manage transactions.
   - Enclose your database operations in a try-catch block and commit or rollback the transaction based on the success or failure of the operations.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
   {
       using (SqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand())
       {
           command.Transaction = transaction;
           try
           {
               command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerName) VALUES ('John Doe')";
               command.ExecuteNonQuery();

               command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (SCOPE_IDENTITY(), 1, 10)";
               command.ExecuteNonQuery();

               transaction.Commit();
           }
           catch
           {
               transaction.Rollback();
               throw;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. Using Asynchronous Operations
**Scenario:**
You are working on a responsive application that should not block the UI thread while performing database operations. How would you implement asynchronous data retrieval?

**Answer:**
   - Use asynchronous methods like `OpenAsync`, `ExecuteReaderAsync`, and `ExecuteNonQueryAsync`.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
   {
       await connection.OpenAsync();

       using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Customers", connection))
       {
           using (SqlDataReader reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync())
           {
               while (await reader.ReadAsync())
               {
                   Console.WriteLine(reader["CustomerName"]);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. Handling Exceptions
**Scenario:**
You need to implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully handle any database-related errors. How would you do this?

**Answer:**
   - Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
   - Catch specific exceptions like `SqlException` to handle SQL Server-specific errors.

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
       {
           connection.Open();
           // Perform database operations
       }
   }
   catch (SqlException ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("SQL Error: " + ex.Message);
       // Handle SQL Server-specific errors
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
       // Handle general errors
   }
   ```

### 6. Working with Disconnected Data
**Scenario:**
You need to manipulate data in-memory and then update the database. How would you use ADO.NET to work with disconnected data?

**Answer:**
   - Use a `DataSet` to work with in-memory data.
   - Use a `SqlDataAdapter` to fill the `DataSet` and update the database.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
   {
       connection.Open();

       SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Customers", connection);
       DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
       adapter.Fill(dataSet, "Customers");

       // Modify data in the DataSet
       DataTable table = dataSet.Tables["Customers"];
       table.Rows[0]["CustomerName"] = "New Name";

       // Update the database
       SqlCommandBuilder commandBuilder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);
       adapter.Update(dataSet, "Customers");
   }
   ```

### 7. Optimizing Data Retrieval
**Scenario:**
You need to retrieve large amounts of data from the database efficiently. How would you optimize data retrieval using ADO.NET?

**Answer:**
   - Use the `SqlDataReader` for forward-only, read-only access to data.
   - Avoid fetching unnecessary columns by specifying only the required columns in your query.

   ```csharp
   using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customers", connection))
   {
       using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
       {
           while (reader.Read())
           {
               Console.WriteLine($"{reader["CustomerID"]}, {reader["CustomerName"]}");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

These scenario-based questions should give you a solid understanding of how to apply ADO.NET concepts in real-world situations using C#.
