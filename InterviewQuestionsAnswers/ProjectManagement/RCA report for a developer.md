A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report for a developer is a structured approach to identify the underlying causes of issues or defects in software development. The goal is to address these root causes to prevent recurrence and improve overall quality. Here's a general outline for an RCA report:

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Report

#### 1. **Problem Statement**

Clearly define the problem or defect. Include details such as when it was discovered, its impact on the project, and any immediate steps taken to mitigate it.

#### 2. **Problem Description**

Provide a detailed description of the issue. Include screenshots, logs, or any relevant data that helps illustrate the problem.

#### 3. **Timeline**

Document the timeline of events leading up to the discovery of the problem. This helps in understanding the sequence of actions and identifying potential points of failure.

#### 4. **Root Cause Identification**

Use techniques like the 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram to identify the root cause of the problem. Ask "Why?" repeatedly until you reach the underlying cause.

#### 5. **Contributing Factors**

List any contributing factors that led to the problem. These could include human errors, process flaws, technical issues, or external factors.

#### 6. **Corrective Actions**

Propose corrective actions to address the root cause and prevent recurrence. Include specific steps, responsible persons, and timelines for implementation.

#### 7. **Preventive Measures**

Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future. This could involve changes in processes, additional training, or improvements in tools and infrastructure.

#### 8. **Follow-Up**

Plan for follow-up actions to ensure that the corrective and preventive measures are effective. Schedule reviews and audits to monitor progress.

#### 9. **Conclusion**

Summarize the findings and actions taken. Highlight the importance of addressing root causes to improve quality and reliability.
