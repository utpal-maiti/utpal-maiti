Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. ASP.NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, making it easy to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling within your application. Letâ€™s dive into the details of how to use DI in an ASP.NET Core Web API.

### 1. What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a technique where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling, easier testing, and better code maintainability.

### 2. Setting Up Dependency Injection

In ASP.NET Core, services are registered in the `Startup.cs` file and can be injected into controllers or other services.

#### Step-by-Step Example:

### Step 1: Define the Service Interface and Implementation

First, create a service interface and its implementation.

#### Service Interface:

```csharp
public interface IProductService
{
    IEnumerable<string> GetProducts();
    string GetProductById(int id);
    void AddProduct(string product);
    void UpdateProduct(int id, string product);
    void DeleteProduct(int id);
}
```

#### Service Implementation:

```csharp
public class ProductService : IProductService
{
    private readonly List<string> _products;

    public ProductService()
    {
        _products = new List<string> { "Product1", "Product2", "Product3" };
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> GetProducts()
    {
        return _products;
    }

    public string GetProductById(int id)
    {
        if (id < 0 || id >= _products.Count)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return _products[id];
    }

    public void AddProduct(string product)
    {
        _products.Add(product);
    }

    public void UpdateProduct(int id, string product)
    {
        if (id < 0 || id >= _products.Count)
        {
            return;
        }
        _products[id] = product;
    }

    public void DeleteProduct(int id)
    {
        if (id < 0 || id >= _products.Count)
        {
            return;
        }
        _products.RemoveAt(id);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register the Service in `Startup.cs`

Next, register the service in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class.

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();

        // Register the ProductService with the dependency injection container
        services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Inject the Service into a Controller

Finally, inject the registered service into a controller and use it to handle HTTP requests.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetAll()
    {
        var products = _productService.GetProducts();
        return Ok(products);
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetById(int id)
    {
        var product = _productService.GetProductById(id);
        if (product == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }
        return Ok(product);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create([FromBody] string product)
    {
        _productService.AddProduct(product);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = _productService.GetProducts().Count() - 1 }, product);
    }

    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Update(int id, [FromBody] string product)
    {
        _productService.UpdateProduct(id, product);
        return NoContent();
    }

    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Delete(int id)
    {
        _productService.DeleteProduct(id);
        return NoContent();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Service Interface and Implementation**:

   - The `IProductService` interface defines the contract for the product service.
   - The `ProductService` class implements this interface, providing the actual logic for managing products.

2. **Registering the Service**:

   - In the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class, the `AddScoped` method registers the `ProductService` as a scoped service. Scoped services are created once per client request.

3. **Injecting the Service**:
   - The `ProductsController` constructor takes an `IProductService` parameter, which is automatically provided by the DI container.
   - The action methods in `ProductsController` use the `IProductService` to handle HTTP requests and manage products.

### Conclusion

Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core allows you to manage dependencies efficiently and promotes loose coupling within your application. By registering services in `Startup.cs` and injecting them into controllers or other services, you can create a maintainable and testable codebase.

ASP.NET Core has built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI), which is a design pattern used to manage and resolve dependencies between classes. There are three main types of DI in ASP.NET Core: **Constructor Injection**, **Property Injection**, and **Method Injection**. Let's explore each type in detail.

### 1. Constructor Injection

Constructor injection is the most common and preferred form of DI in ASP.NET Core. Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.

#### Example:

```csharp
public interface IMessageService
{
    string GetMessage();
}

public class MessageService : IMessageService
{
    public string GetMessage()
    {
        return "Hello, Dependency Injection!";
    }
}

public class HomeController
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public HomeController(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public string Index()
    {
        return _messageService.GetMessage();
    }
}
```

#### Registering the Service in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddScoped<IMessageService, MessageService>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Property Injection

Property injection involves setting dependencies through public properties. This method is less common and usually used when the dependency is optional or can be changed at runtime.

#### Example:

```csharp
public class HomeController
{
    public IMessageService MessageService { get; set; }

    public string Index()
    {
        if (MessageService == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("MessageService not set.");
        }
        return MessageService.GetMessage();
    }
}
```

### 3. Method Injection

Method injection involves passing dependencies directly into method parameters. This method is useful for injecting dependencies into methods that are not part of the class constructor.

#### Example:

```csharp
public class HomeController
{
    public string Index(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        return messageService.GetMessage();
    }
}
```

### Summary of Dependency Injection Types

1. **Constructor Injection**:

   - Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
   - Most common and preferred method.
   - Ensures that dependencies are available when the class is instantiated.

2. **Property Injection**:

   - Dependencies are provided through public properties.
   - Useful for optional dependencies or when the dependency can change at runtime.

3. **Method Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided directly into method parameters.
   - Useful for injecting dependencies into methods not part of the constructor.

### Service Lifetimes

In ASP.NET Core, services can have different lifetimes which define how they are instantiated and reused:

- **Transient**: A new instance is created each time the service is requested.

  ```csharp
  services.AddTransient<IMessageService, MessageService>();
  ```

- **Scoped**: A new instance is created once per request.

  ```csharp
  services.AddScoped<IMessageService, MessageService>();
  ```

- **Singleton**: A single instance is created and shared throughout the application's lifetime.
  ```csharp
  services.AddSingleton<IMessageService, MessageService>();
  ```

By understanding and utilizing these types of dependency injection and service lifetimes, you can manage dependencies efficiently and create a maintainable, testable, and loosely coupled application in ASP.NET Core.

Service lifetimes in ASP.NET Core define how services are instantiated and managed within the application's dependency injection (DI) container. Understanding when to use each lifetime is crucial for creating efficient and maintainable applications. Let's explore practical use cases for each service lifetime: **Transient**, **Scoped**, and **Singleton**.

### 1. Transient Services

#### Use Case Scenario:

**Logging Services**

When dealing with logging, you might want to create a new instance of the logger for each request to ensure that log data is isolated and not shared across different requests.

#### Example:

```csharp
public interface ILoggingService
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class LoggingService : ILoggingService
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Log the message
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

// Register the service
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddTransient<ILoggingService, LoggingService>();
    }
}
```

### 2. Scoped Services

#### Use Case Scenario:

**Database Contexts**

A common use case for scoped services is a database context, such as Entity Framework's `DbContext`. You want a single instance of the `DbContext` to be used for the duration of a single request to ensure consistent data management and transaction handling.

#### Example:

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public MyDbContext(DbContextOptions<MyDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}

// Register the service
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    }
}
```

### 3. Singleton Services

#### Use Case Scenario:

**Caching Services**

A caching service is a good example of when to use a singleton lifetime. You want a single instance of the caching service to be shared across the entire application, providing a centralized cache store for all users and requests.

#### Example:

```csharp
public interface ICacheService
{
    void Set(string key, object value);
    object Get(string key);
}

public class CacheService : ICacheService
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, object> _cache = new Dictionary<string, object>();

    public void Set(string key, object value)
    {
        _cache[key] = value;
    }

    public object Get(string key)
    {
        _cache.TryGetValue(key, out var value);
        return value;
    }
}

// Register the service
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, CacheService>();
    }
}
```

### Summary of Service Lifetimes

1. **Transient**:

   - **Use When**: You need a new instance of the service for each request.
   - **Example**: Logging services, lightweight utility services.

2. **Scoped**:

   - **Use When**: You want a single instance of the service per request.
   - **Example**: Database contexts, unit of work services.

3. **Singleton**:
   - **Use When**: You need a single instance of the service to be shared across the entire application.
   - **Example**: Caching services, configuration services, background task services.

By understanding and utilizing these service lifetimes appropriately, you can ensure efficient resource management and maintainability within your ASP.NET Core application.
