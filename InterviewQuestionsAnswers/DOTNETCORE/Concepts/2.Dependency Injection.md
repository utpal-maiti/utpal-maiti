Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental design pattern in .NET Core that helps manage dependencies between classes, promoting loose coupling and easier testing. Let's explore DI in .NET Core with C#.

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a technique where an object (dependency) is passed to a class instead of the class creating the object itself. This way, the class depends on external sources for its dependencies, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

### Types of Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Property Injection**: Dependencies are provided through public properties.
3. **Method Injection**: Dependencies are provided through method parameters.

### Setting Up Dependency Injection in .NET Core

#### Step 1: Define an Interface and a Service

First, define an interface and a class that implements this interface.

```csharp
public interface IMyService
{
    void DoWork();
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyService is doing work.");
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Register the Service

In the `Startup` class, register the service with the DI container.

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Registering the service with transient lifetime
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
            });
        });
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Inject the Service

Inject the service into a controller or a class using constructor injection.

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        _myService.DoWork();
        return View();
    }
}
```

### Service Lifetimes

1. **Transient**: Created each time they are requested. They are not shared between requests.
   ```csharp
   services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

2. **Scoped**: Created once per request within the scope. They are shared across the request.
   ```csharp
   services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

3. **Singleton**: Created the first time they are requested, and then every subsequent request will use the same instance.
   ```csharp
   services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

### Built-in Services

.NET Core provides several built-in services that you can inject into your classes:

- **Logging**
   ```csharp
   private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;
   
   public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
   {
       _logger = logger;
   }
   ```

- **Configuration**
   ```csharp
   private readonly IConfiguration _config;
   
   public HomeController(IConfiguration config)
   {
       _config = config;
   }
   ```

### Example: Using Dependency Injection in a Console Application

Here's a simple example of using DI in a .NET Core console application:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
        ConfigureServices(serviceCollection);

        var serviceProvider = serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
        var myService = serviceProvider.GetService<IMyService>();

        myService.DoWork();
    }

    private static void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Dependency Injection is a powerful pattern that helps manage dependencies in .NET Core applications, making your code more modular and easier to test. By leveraging DI, you can write cleaner and more maintainable code.
