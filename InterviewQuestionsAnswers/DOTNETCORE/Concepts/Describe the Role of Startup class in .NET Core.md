The `Startup` class in .NET Core plays a crucial role in configuring the application's services and request handling pipeline. Here's a breakdown of its key responsibilities:

### 1. **Configuration**
- The `Startup` class has a `Configure` method where you define how the application will respond to HTTP requests. This method takes an `IApplicationBuilder` parameter and typically also receives `IHostingEnvironment` and `ILoggerFactory` for further configuration.
- Inside `Configure`, you set up the request processing pipeline using middleware components. Middleware can include things like authentication, logging, static file serving, and routing.

### 2. **Service Registration**
- The `Startup` class also includes a `ConfigureServices` method. This is where you register services for Dependency Injection (DI). 
- The `ConfigureServices` method takes an `IServiceCollection` parameter and is used to add services that the application will use, such as MVC, EF Core, Identity, etc.

### Example:
Here's a simple example of a `Startup` class:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Register application services
        services.AddControllersWithViews();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **ConfigureServices**: Adds services to the DI container.
- **Configure**: Defines the HTTP request pipeline using middleware.

### Middleware Components:
Common middleware components you might configure include:
- `UseRouting()`
- `UseEndpoints()`
- `UseStaticFiles()`
- `UseAuthentication()`
- `UseAuthorization()`

The `Startup` class is a cornerstone of configuring and initializing .NET Core applications, providing a flexible and modular approach to setting up your app's behavior.
