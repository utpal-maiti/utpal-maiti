Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of the key differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core:

1. **Platform**: 
    - **.NET Framework**: Primarily designed for Windows and runs on Windows environments.
    - **.NET Core**: Cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes .NET Core more versatile for different environments.

2. **Performance**:
    - **.NET Framework**: While stable and robust, it's generally not as performance-optimized for modern needs as .NET Core.
    - **.NET Core**: Designed for high performance and scalability. It’s optimized to handle modern workloads efficiently.

3. **Modular Architecture**:
    - **.NET Framework**: Monolithic in structure. The applications have to include everything, which can make them larger.
    - **.NET Core**: Modular and lightweight. You can include only the packages and libraries you need, making your applications leaner.

4. **Deployment**:
    - **.NET Framework**: Usually installed on the system globally. Versioning can be an issue since applications share the same runtime.
    - **.NET Core**: Allows side-by-side installations of different versions on the same machine. This isolation avoids version conflicts.

5. **Development and Maintenance**:
    - **.NET Framework**: Continues to receive maintenance and critical updates but no new major developments are planned.
    - **.NET Core**: Actively developed with new features, improvements, and updates. Microsoft’s focus is on .NET Core and its successor, .NET 5 and beyond.

6. **Open Source**:
    - **.NET Framework**: Largely closed-source with some open-source components.
    - **.NET Core**: Fully open-source and community-driven, with contributions from developers around the world.

7. **API and Libraries**:
    - **.NET Framework**: Comes with a comprehensive class library but some newer APIs and libraries are not supported.
    - **.NET Core**: Has a subset of .NET Framework libraries but also includes many new APIs and libraries for modern development needs.

**Summary**:
- **.NET Framework** is best for legacy applications and systems confined to Windows.
- **.NET Core** is the go-to for new, cross-platform, and performance-critical projects.
