Sure! Here's a detailed overview of each topic:

### Basic OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data with methods that operate on that data.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

### Basic .NET
- **Framework**: A software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: The virtual machine component of .NET that manages the execution of .NET programs.
- **FCL (Framework Class Library)**: A standard library that provides a range of functionalities like file reading and writing, database interaction, etc.

### .NET Core
- **Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system.
- **Dependency Injection**: A design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing for better modularity and testing.
- **Lifetime**: Defines how long a service should be kept alive (Transient, Scoped, Singleton).

### Microservices
- **Communication**: Typically done using HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues like RabbitMQ.
- **Transactions**: Managed using patterns like Saga, which ensures data consistency across multiple microservices.

### SQL
- **Group By**: Used to arrange identical data into groups.
- **Having**: Used to filter records that work on summarized GROUP BY results.
- **Join**: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **Performance Improvement**: Techniques like indexing, query optimization, and proper schema design.

### Entity Framework, LINQ, and Lambda Expressions
- **Entity Framework**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: A query syntax in C# for querying collections.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Anonymous functions used to create delegates or expression tree types.

### Azure
- **Service Bus**: A messaging service for connecting applications and services.
- **Storage Types**: Includes Blob Storage, Table Storage, Queue Storage, and File Storage.
- **Functions**: Serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.

### Unit Test Cases and Code Coverage
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual units/components of a software.
- **Code Coverage**: A measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested.

### Hands-on on Code
- Practical experience in writing, debugging, and optimizing code.

### C# and Memory Management
- **IDisposable Pattern**: A design pattern for releasing unmanaged resources.
- **Memory Management**: Techniques like garbage collection, and managing memory allocation and deallocation.

### Design Patterns and Principles
- **Design Patterns**: Solutions to common software design problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
- **Principles**: Guidelines for writing clean, maintainable code (e.g., SOLID principles).
