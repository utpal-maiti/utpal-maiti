Sure thing! Let's dive into the hash-related concepts in the C# collection framework. Here's a quick overview:

### Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. In C#, the `Hashtable` class represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.

### HashSet
A `HashSet<T>` is a collection of unique elements. It's implemented using a hash table for quick lookups, ensuring that duplicate elements are not stored. It's part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace.

### HashMap
In C#, the equivalent of a `HashMap` (as found in Java) is the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`. It stores key-value pairs and allows for fast retrieval based on the key. It's also implemented using a hash table.

### Comparing them

| Concept    | Implementation | Use Case                                  |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Hashtable  | Non-generic    | Key-value pairs with non-generic keys     |
| HashSet    | Generic        | Unique elements without duplicates        |
| HashMap    | Generic        | Key-value pairs with generic keys         |

### Example Usage

- **Hashtable**:
```csharp
Hashtable hashtable = new Hashtable();
hashtable.Add("key1", "value1");
hashtable.Add("key2", "value2");
```

- **HashSet**:
```csharp
HashSet<int> hashSet = new HashSet<int>();
hashSet.Add(1);
hashSet.Add(2);
```

- **Dictionary (HashMap)**:
```csharp
Dictionary<string, string> dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();
dictionary.Add("key1", "value1");
dictionary.Add("key2", "value2");
```
