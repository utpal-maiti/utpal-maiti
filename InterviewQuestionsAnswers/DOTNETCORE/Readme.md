.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It's developed by Microsoft and provides a range of features and improvements over the traditional .NET Framework.

### Key Features of .NET Core

1. **Cross-Platform**: .NET Core applications can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it highly versatile for developing applications that need to be deployed across different environments.

2. **Performance**: .NET Core is optimized for performance. It includes a modular architecture that allows developers to include only the necessary libraries, reducing the application's footprint and improving startup times.

3. **Unified Development Platform**: .NET Core supports a wide range of application types, including web, mobile, desktop, cloud, gaming, IoT, and AI.

4. **Command-Line Tools**: .NET Core includes a set of powerful command-line tools that simplify the development, building, and deployment process.

5. **Compatibility**: It is compatible with .NET Standard, allowing code reuse across different .NET platforms.

6. **Open Source**: .NET Core is open-source and has a large and active community contributing to its development. This ensures continuous improvement and innovation.

### Key Components of .NET Core

- **.NET Runtime**: Provides a type system, assembly loading, a garbage collector, native interop, and other basic services.
- **.NET Libraries**: A set of libraries and APIs that applications can use, such as collections, file IO, and network communication.
- **.NET SDK**: Tools and libraries for developing and running .NET applications. The SDK includes the .NET CLI, compilers, and MSBuild.
- **ASP.NET Core**: A framework for building web applications and services with .NET Core.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET Core, providing a way to work with databases using .NET objects.

### Example of a Simple .NET Core Application

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a .NET Core console application:

1. **Create a new .NET Core project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n MyDotNetCoreApp
   cd MyDotNetCoreApp
   ```

2. **Edit the Program.cs file** to add your code:

   ```csharp
   using System;

   namespace MyDotNetCoreApp
   {
       class Program
       {
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Build and run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

### Developing Web Applications with ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs using .NET Core.

1. **Create a new ASP.NET Core project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet new webapp -n MyWebApp
   cd MyWebApp
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

This will start a web server and host your web application. You can navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see your application in action.

### Learning Resources
