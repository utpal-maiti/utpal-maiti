## [.NET Core Concepts and Labs](https://github.com/utpal-maiti/DOTNET_CORE/)

.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. Here are some key concepts associated with .NET Core:

### 1. **Cross-Platform Development**

.NET Core allows you to build applications that can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform capability ensures that developers can write code once and run it anywhere.

### 2. **High Performance**

.NET Core is designed for high performance. It includes a lightweight, modular runtime and libraries that optimize performance. It supports advanced optimizations, such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation.

### 3. **Unified Framework**

.NET Core provides a unified framework for building various types of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, cloud, gaming, and IoT applications. This unification makes it easier for developers to share code and libraries across different types of projects.

### 4. **Modular Architecture**

.NET Core follows a modular architecture, allowing developers to include only the libraries and components they need for their applications. This modularity helps reduce the application size and improve performance.

### 5. **Package Management**

.NET Core uses NuGet, a package manager, to manage libraries and dependencies. NuGet allows developers to easily add, update, and manage third-party libraries and packages in their projects.

### 6. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

.NET Core includes a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows developers to create, build, run, and publish .NET Core applications using simple commands. The CLI is essential for automating development workflows and integrating with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### 7. **ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core is a framework for building web applications and APIs. It is built on top of .NET Core and provides features such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Razor Pages, Blazor, and Web APIs. ASP.NET Core is known for its performance, scalability, and flexibility.

### 8. **Entity Framework Core**

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET Core. It enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need to write SQL queries. EF Core supports various database providers, including SQL Server, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.

### 9. **Dependency Injection**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern supported by .NET Core that allows for the decoupling of dependencies and promotes modular and testable code. .NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, making it easier to manage service lifetimes and dependencies.

### 10. **Configuration and Options**

.NET Core provides a flexible configuration system that supports various configuration sources, such as JSON files, environment variables, command-line arguments, and more. The configuration system allows for easy management of application settings and options.

### 11. **Logging and Diagnostics**

.NET Core includes built-in logging and diagnostics support, allowing developers to capture and analyze application logs and telemetry. The logging framework is extensible and supports various logging providers, such as Console, Debug, EventSource, and third-party providers like Serilog and NLog.

### 12. **Middleware**

Middleware are components that handle HTTP requests and responses in ASP.NET Core applications. Middleware components are executed in a pipeline, allowing developers to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and error handling. Custom middleware can be created to handle specific application requirements.

### 13. **Security**

.NET Core includes various security features, such as authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure communication. ASP.NET Core supports multiple authentication methods, including cookies, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, and OpenID Connect. It also provides built-in support for HTTPS, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, and data encryption.

### 14. **Unit Testing**

.NET Core supports unit testing with popular testing frameworks, such as xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest. The framework includes tools and libraries that make it easy to write, run, and manage unit tests, ensuring the quality and reliability of the code.

### Example: Creating a Simple .NET Core Console Application

1. **Install .NET Core SDK**
   Download and install the .NET Core SDK from the official website: [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

2. **Create a New Console Application**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   dotnet new console -o MyConsoleApp
   cd MyConsoleApp
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Run the following command to build and run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   This will create and run a simple console application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Conclusion

.NET Core is a versatile and powerful framework that enables developers to build a wide range of applications. Its cross-platform capabilities, high performance, and rich set of features make it an excellent choice for modern application development.
