public class GrandParent { public GrandParent() { Console.WriteLine("Hi, I am grand parent!!"); } public virtual void Computer() { Console.WriteLine("This PC has 4 GB RAM!"); } } public class Parent : GrandParent { public Parent() { Console.WriteLine("Hi, I am parent!!"); } public override void Computer() { Console.WriteLine("This PC has 8 GB RAM!"); } } public class Child : Parent { public Child() { Console.WriteLine("Hi, I am child!!"); } public new void Computer() { Console.WriteLine("This PC has 16 GB RAM!!"); } } GrandParent grandParent = new Child(); what would be the output


Given the provided code and the instantiation `GrandParent grandParent = new Child();`, the output will be:

```
Hi, I am grand parent!!
Hi, I am parent!!
Hi, I am child!!
This PC has 8 GB RAM!
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:
1. When `new Child()` is called, the constructors are executed in order from the `GrandParent` class to the `Parent` class, and finally to the `Child` class, because constructors are always called from the base class upwards in an inheritance hierarchy.
2. "Hi, I am grand parent!!" is printed first from the `GrandParent` constructor.
3. "Hi, I am parent!!" is printed second from the `Parent` constructor.
4. "Hi, I am child!!" is printed third from the `Child` constructor.
5. When `grandParent.Computer()` is called, since `grandParent` is of type `GrandParent` but actually refers to an instance of `Child`, the `Computer` method from `Parent` class will be called because it is the overridden version that `GrandParent` recognizes. This results in "This PC has 8 GB RAM!" being printed.

The `new` keyword in the `Child` class creates a new method, but it doesn't override the `Computer` method from the `Parent` class. Thus, the overridden method from the `Parent` class is called instead of the `new` method from the `Child` class.
