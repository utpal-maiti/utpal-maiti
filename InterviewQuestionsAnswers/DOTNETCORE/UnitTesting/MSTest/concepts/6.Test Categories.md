Test categories in MSTest are used to group and organize tests based on certain characteristics. This allows you to filter and run specific subsets of tests, making it easier to manage large test suites and focus on particular types of tests. The primary attribute used for categorizing tests in MSTest is `[TestCategory]`.

### Using [TestCategory] Attribute

#### 1. Applying [TestCategory] to Test Methods
You can apply the `[TestCategory]` attribute to individual test methods to categorize them.

##### Example:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory("Unit")]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory("Integration")]
    public void Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Subtract(5, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result);
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `Add_ReturnsCorrectSum` method is categorized as a "Unit" test.
- The `Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference` method is categorized as an "Integration" test.

#### 2. Applying [TestCategory] to Test Classes
You can also apply the `[TestCategory]` attribute to an entire test class. This will categorize all test methods within the class.

##### Example:
```csharp
[TestClass]
[TestCategory("Unit")]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Subtract(5, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result);
    }
}
```
In this example, both test methods in the `CalculatorTests` class are categorized as "Unit" tests.

### Combining Multiple Categories

You can apply multiple `[TestCategory]` attributes to a single test method or class. This allows for more granular categorization and filtering.

##### Example:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory("Unit")]
    [TestCategory("Arithmetic")]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory("Integration")]
    [TestCategory("Arithmetic")]
    public void Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Subtract(5, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result);
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `Add_ReturnsCorrectSum` method is categorized as both "Unit" and "Arithmetic".
- The `Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference` method is categorized as both "Integration" and "Arithmetic".

### Running Tests by Category

#### 1. Visual Studio Test Explorer
In Visual Studio, you can filter tests by category using the Test Explorer:
- Open the Test Explorer.
- Click the filter dropdown.
- Select "Traits" and choose the desired category.

#### 2. Command Line
You can run tests by category using the MSTest command-line tool:
```bash
vstest.console.exe YourTestAssembly.dll /TestCaseFilter:"TestCategory=Unit"
```
In this example, only tests categorized as "Unit" will be executed.

### Benefits of Using Test Categories

1. **Selective Execution**: Run specific groups of tests based on their category. This is useful for running only unit tests, integration tests, or any other logical grouping you define.
2. **Organization**: Categorize tests to keep your test suite organized and manageable, especially in large projects.
3. **Focused Testing**: Focus on particular types of tests during development, CI/CD pipelines, or release processes.
