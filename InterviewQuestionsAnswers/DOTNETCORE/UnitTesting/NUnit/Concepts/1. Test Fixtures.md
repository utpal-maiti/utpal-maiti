In NUnit, test fixtures are essential for organizing and grouping tests. They allow you to define a shared context for multiple test methods, ensuring that common setup and teardown logic is handled efficiently. Here's a detailed look at how to use test fixtures in NUnit:

### Key Concepts of Test Fixtures

1. **Test Fixtures with [TestFixture] Attribute**
   - The `[TestFixture]` attribute marks a class that contains tests.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [TestFixture]
     public class CalculatorTests
     {
         // Test methods go here
     }
     ```

2. **Setup and Teardown Methods**
   - **[SetUp]**: Runs before each test method to initialize the test environment.
   - **[TearDown]**: Runs after each test method to clean up the test environment.
   - **[OneTimeSetUp]**: Runs once before all test methods in the class to perform one-time initialization.
   - **[OneTimeTearDown]**: Runs once after all test methods in the class to perform one-time cleanup.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [TestFixture]
     public class CalculatorTests
     {
         private Calculator calculator;

         [OneTimeSetUp]
         public void Init()
         {
             // Runs once before any tests
             calculator = new Calculator();
         }

         [SetUp]
         public void Setup()
         {
             // Runs before each test
         }

         [Test]
         public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
         {
             int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
             Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
         }

         [TearDown]
         public void Cleanup()
         {
             // Runs after each test
         }

         [OneTimeTearDown]
         public void Dispose()
         {
             // Runs once after all tests
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Parameterized Test Fixtures**
   - NUnit allows you to create parameterized test fixtures to run tests with different sets of parameters.
   - Use the `[TestFixture]` attribute with parameters.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [TestFixture(2, 3, 5)]
     [TestFixture(-1, -1, -2)]
     public class CalculatorTests
     {
         private readonly int a;
         private readonly int b;
         private readonly int expected;

         public CalculatorTests(int a, int b, int expected)
         {
             this.a = a;
             this.b = b;
             this.expected = expected;
         }

         [Test]
         public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
         {
             var calculator = new Calculator();
             int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
             Assert.AreEqual(expected, result);
         }
     }
     ```

### Benefits of Using Test Fixtures

1. **Efficiency**: Shared setup and teardown logic is executed only once per test class or once per test run, reducing redundancy and improving performance.
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized setup and teardown logic make your tests easier to maintain and understand.
3. **Flexibility**: Parameterized test fixtures allow you to run the same set of tests with different parameters, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

### Advanced Usage

#### Multiple Test Fixtures in a Single Class
You can define multiple test fixtures in a single class by using different sets of parameters.

```csharp
[TestFixture(2, 3, 5)]
[TestFixture(4, 5, 9)]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    private readonly int a;
    private readonly int b;
    private readonly int expected;

    public CalculatorTests(int a, int b, int expected)
    {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
        this.expected = expected;
    }

    [Test]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
        Assert.AreEqual(expected, result);
    }
}
```

#### Shared Context with Test Fixtures and Inheritance
You can use inheritance to share setup and teardown logic across multiple test classes.

```csharp
public class TestBase
{
    protected Calculator calculator;

    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public void Init()
    {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }
}

[TestFixture]
public class AddTests : TestBase
{
    [Test]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
    }
}

[TestFixture]
public class SubtractTests : TestBase
{
    [Test]
    public void Subtract_ReturnsCorrectDifference()
    {
        int result = calculator.Subtract(5, 3);
        Assert.AreEqual(2, result);
    }
}
```

By using test fixtures in NUnit, you can efficiently manage the setup and teardown of resources
