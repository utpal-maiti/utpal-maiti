**Expected response:**

- Setting up authentication credentials (basic, form-based, API tokens)
- Using Veracode’s authentication recording tool
- Validating scan scope and URLs
- Reviewing scan logs and error messages

---

### 🧩 **3. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Scenario**

**Question:**  
_Your team uses open-source libraries. A Veracode SCA scan flags a critical vulnerability in a popular package. What steps do you take?_

**Expected response:**

- Review the CVE details and exploitability
- Check if a patched version is available
- Assess impact on the application
- Plan and test the upgrade
- Use Veracode’s SCA remediation guidance

---

### 🛠️ **4. Developer Workflow Scenario**

**Question:**  
_How would you integrate Veracode into a developer’s daily workflow to ensure secure coding practices?_

**Expected response:**

- IDE integration for real-time feedback
- Use of sandbox scans for pre-commit testing
- Developer training via Veracode Security Labs
- Automating scans in CI/CD pipelines

---

### 📊 **5. Policy Management Scenario**

**Question:**  
_Your organization has strict compliance requirements. How do you configure Veracode to enforce these through policies?_

**Expected response:**

- Creating custom policies in Veracode
- Setting severity thresholds and remediation deadlines
- Mapping policies to standards (e.g., OWASP, PCI-DSS)
- Monitoring compliance through dashboards

---

### 🔄 **6. CI/CD Integration Scenario**

**Question:**  
_You need to integrate Veracode scans into a Jenkins pipeline. What steps would you follow?_

**Expected response:**

- Install Veracode Jenkins plugin
- Configure API credentials securely
- Add scan steps in the pipeline script
- Handle scan results and fail builds on policy violations

---

### 📈 **7. Reporting and Metrics Scenario**

**Question:**  
_Your CISO asks for a quarterly report on application security posture. How do you generate and present this using Veracode?_

**Expected response:**

- Use Veracode’s analytics dashboard
- Export reports on flaw trends, policy compliance, and remediation rates
- Highlight high-risk applications and improvement areas

---

### 🧪 **8. Pre-Production Release Scenario**

**Question:**  
_An application is about to go live. What Veracode scans would you run, and how would you ensure it’s secure for release?_

**Expected response:**

- Run a full policy scan (SAST)
- Perform DAST on staging
- Conduct SCA for open-source risks
- Ensure all policy violations are resolved or mitigated

---

### 🧠 **9. False Positive Handling Scenario**

**Question:**  
_A developer claims a Veracode finding is a false positive. How do you verify and handle it?_

**Expected response:**

- Review the code and flaw details
- Use Veracode’s mitigation request process
- Provide justification and evidence
- Track mitigation status in the platform

---

### 🔐 **10. Secure SDLC Scenario**

**Question:**  
_How would you embed Veracode into a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)?_

**Expected response:**

- SAST during coding and build stages
- SCA during dependency management
- DAST in QA/staging
