Here are some **scenario-based interview questions** related to **SonarQube**, along with detailed explanations of what interviewers typically look for in responses. These questions are designed to assess both **practical experience** and **problem-solving skills** in real-world situations.

---

### 🔧 **1. Scenario: Quality Gate Failure in CI/CD**

**Question:**  
_Your build pipeline fails because the SonarQube quality gate did not pass. How would you handle this situation?_

**What to cover:**

- Check the **SonarQube dashboard** for the failed conditions (e.g., new bugs, low coverage).
- Identify whether the issue is in **new code** or **legacy code**.
- Collaborate with the developer to fix the issue or justify an exception.
- Optionally, **customize the quality gate** if the rule is too strict for the context.

---

### 🧪 **2. Scenario: Low Code Coverage**

**Question:**  
_SonarQube shows that your project has only 40% code coverage. What steps would you take to improve it?_

**What to cover:**

- Identify **critical modules** with low coverage.
- Write **unit tests** for untested code paths.
- Use tools like **JaCoCo** or **Istanbul** to generate coverage reports.
- Integrate coverage reports with SonarQube.
- Focus on **new code** first (Clean as You Code).

---

### 🔐 **3. Scenario: Security Vulnerabilities Detected**

**Question:**  
_SonarQube has flagged several security vulnerabilities in your code. How do you prioritize and address them?_

**What to cover:**

- Review the **severity** and **type** of vulnerabilities.
- Map them to **OWASP/CWE** standards.
- Fix **critical and blocker** issues first.
- Use **Security Hotspot review** for manual inspection.
- Involve security experts if needed.

---

### 🧰 **4. Scenario: Custom Rule Requirement**

**Question:**  
_Your team wants to enforce a specific coding standard not covered by default SonarQube rules. How would you implement this?_

**What to cover:**

- Create a **custom rule** using SonarQube plugin development (e.g., for Java using SonarJava).
- Use **XPath rules** for XML or **Regex rules** for simple patterns.
- Add the rule to a **custom Quality Profile**.
- Test and validate the rule before applying it to production.

---

### 🔄 **5. Scenario: Legacy Code with Many Issues**

**Question:**  
_You onboard a legacy project with thousands of SonarQube issues. How do you manage this without overwhelming the team?_

**What to cover:**

- Define a **New Code** policy (e.g., since last release).
- Focus on **cleaning new code** first.
- Gradually refactor legacy code as part of regular development.
- Use **issue suppression** or **false positive marking** where justified.

---

### 📈 **6. Scenario: SonarQube Integration in CI/CD**

**Question:**  
_How would you integrate SonarQube into a Jenkins/GitLab CI pipeline?_

**What to cover:**

- Install and configure the **SonarQube Scanner**.
- Add a **SonarQube analysis step** in the pipeline.
- Pass necessary parameters (project key, token, server URL).
- Ensure **quality gate status** is checked before proceeding to deployment.

---

### 🧑‍💼 **7. Scenario: Managing Multiple Teams**

**Question:**  
_You manage multiple teams working on different projects. How do you ensure consistent code quality using SonarQube?_

**What to cover:**

- Create **shared Quality Profiles** and **Quality Gates**.
- Assign **project-level permissions**.
- Use **dashboards** to monitor team performance.
- Conduct **periodic reviews** and training.

---

### 📁 **8. Scenario: False Positives in Analysis**

**Question:**  
_SonarQube is reporting false positives. How do you handle them?_

**What to cover:**

- Mark issues as **“Won’t Fix”** or **“False Positive”** with justification.
- Review and possibly **tune rule severity** or disable irrelevant rules.
- Provide feedback to the team or SonarQube community if needed.
