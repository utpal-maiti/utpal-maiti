### Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps you initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from the command line. It simplifies the Angular development workflow, ensuring that your projects are structured in a standardized manner.

#### **Key Features of Angular CLI:**

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Quickly create a new Angular project with predefined configurations.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng new my-angular-app
     ```

2. **Serve Application**
   - Serve your application locally and watch for changes to reload automatically.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```

3. **Generate Components, Services, and Modules**
   - Generate Angular components, services, modules, directives, and more.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng generate component my-component
     ng generate service my-service
     ```

4. **Build Application**
   - Build your application for different environments, including development and production.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng build --prod
     ```

5. **Testing**
   - Run unit tests and end-to-end tests.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng test
     ng e2e
     ```

6. **Linting**
   - Check your code for style and lint errors.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng lint
     ```

7. **Updating Dependencies**
   - Update your Angular project’s dependencies to the latest versions.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng update
     ```

8. **Configuration Management**
   - Manage different configurations for various environments (development, production, etc.).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng build --configuration=production
     ```

9. **Angular Universal**
   - Add server-side rendering capabilities to your Angular project.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
     ```

#### **Common Commands**

- **Creating a New Project**:
  ```bash
  ng new project-name
  ```

- **Generating a Component**:
  ```bash
  ng generate component component-name
  ```

- **Generating a Service**:
  ```bash
  ng generate service service-name
  ```

- **Running the Application**:
  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```

- **Building the Application**:
  ```bash
  ng build --prod
  ```

- **Running Tests**:
  ```bash
  ng test
  ```

#### **Example Workflow**

1. **Create a New Angular Project**:
   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app
   cd my-angular-app
   ```

2. **Serve the Application**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Generate a Component**:
   ```bash
   ng generate component my-component
   ```

4. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   ```

5. **Run Unit Tests**:
   ```bash
   ng test
   ```

By using the Angular CLI, you can streamline your development process, ensure consistency across your projects, and take advantage of Angular’s powerful features with minimal configuration. It’s an essential tool for Angular developers, helping you build and maintain robust web applications efficiently.
