Configuring custom domain names in Azure API Management (APIM) allows you to expose your API endpoints using your own domain names, such as `api.example.com`, instead of the default Azure subdomain (`apim-service-name.azure-api.net`). Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the key concepts and steps involved:

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **API Management Instance**: Ensure you have an existing API Management instance.
- **Custom Domain Name**: Have a custom domain name that you own or manage.
- **Certificate**: Obtain a valid SSL certificate for your custom domain name. The certificate should include the domain name in the subject or subject alternative name (SAN).

### **2. Configuring Custom Domain Names**
- **Add Custom Domain**: Go to your API Management instance in the Azure portal.
- **Select Custom Domains**: Navigate to the "Custom Domains" section under the "Deployment and Infrastructure" settings.
- **Add New Domain**: Click on the "+" button to add a new custom domain.
- **Enter Domain Details**: Provide the domain name and select the appropriate SSL certificate.
- **Save Configuration**: Save the configuration to apply the custom domain name.

### **3. DNS Configuration**
- **Update DNS Records**: Update your DNS records to point your custom domain name to the default domain name of your API Management instance. This ensures that requests to your custom domain are correctly routed to your API Management instance.
- **Propagation Time**: Allow some time for DNS changes to propagate across the internet.

### **4. Using Custom Domain Names**
- **API Requests**: Once configured, you can use your custom domain name to access your APIs. For example, instead of `https://apim-service-name.azure-api.net/products`, you can use `https://api.example.com/products`.
- **Developer Portal**: The developer portal can also be accessed using the custom domain name, providing a seamless experience for developers.

### **5. Best Practices**
- **Security**: Ensure that your SSL certificate is valid and up-to-date to maintain secure communication.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the performance and usage of your custom domain names to detect any issues early.
- **Documentation**: Update your API documentation to reflect the use of custom domain names, helping developers understand how to access your APIs.

By configuring custom domain names, you can enhance the branding and user experience of your APIs, making them more recognizable and accessible to developers and consumers.
