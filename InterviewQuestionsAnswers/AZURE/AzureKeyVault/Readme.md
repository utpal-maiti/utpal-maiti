# [Azure Key Vault & Labs](https://github.com/utpal-maiti/Azure_Key_Vault/)

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage and management of sensitive information, such as secrets, encryption keys, and certificates. It is designed to help safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. Here’s a detailed look at the core concepts of Azure Key Vault:

### Core Concepts of Azure Key Vault

#### 1. **Secrets Management**

- **Overview**: Azure Key Vault allows you to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, database connection strings, API keys, and other secrets.
- **Access Control**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage access to secrets.
- **Versioning**: Key Vault supports versioning of secrets, allowing you to maintain and access multiple versions of a secret.

#### 2. **Key Management**

- **Overview**: Azure Key Vault provides key management capabilities, allowing you to create, import, and manage cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption operations.
- **Key Types**: Supports multiple key types, including RSA and elliptic curve keys.
- **Key Operations**: Perform key operations such as sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, wrap, and unwrap.

#### 3. **Certificate Management**

- **Overview**: Azure Key Vault helps you manage SSL/TLS certificates, including their issuance, renewal, and lifetime management.
- **Certificate Authorities**: Integrate with public Certificate Authorities (CAs) and use Key Vault to obtain and manage certificates.
- **Policy Management**: Define and enforce policies for certificate renewal and expiration.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Security and Access Control**

- **Azure AD Integration**: Use Azure AD to authenticate and authorize access to Key Vault.
- **RBAC**: Implement Role-Based Access Control to manage permissions for accessing and managing secrets, keys, and certificates.
- **Access Policies**: Configure access policies to define who can perform specific actions on Key Vault resources.

#### 2. **Logging and Monitoring**

- **Azure Monitor**: Integrate with Azure Monitor to track and log activities within Key Vault.
- **Diagnostic Logs**: Enable diagnostic logging to capture detailed information about operations and access to Key Vault resources.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts to notify you of specific events, such as secret expirations or unauthorized access attempts.

#### 3. **High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

- **Geo-Replication**: Key Vault supports geo-replication, ensuring high availability and redundancy across multiple regions.
- **Backup and Restore**: Use the backup and restore capabilities to protect your keys, secrets, and certificates and recover them in case of accidental deletion or disaster.

### Example: Using Azure Key Vault with Azure CLI

Here’s an example of how to create a Key Vault, add a secret, and retrieve the secret using Azure CLI:

1. **Create a Resource Group**:

   ```bash
   az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
   ```

2. **Create a Key Vault**:

   ```bash
   az keyvault create --name myKeyVault --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus
   ```

3. **Add a Secret to Key Vault**:

   ```bash
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name myKeyVault --name mySecret --value "mySecretValue"
   ```

4. **Retrieve the Secret from Key Vault**:
   ```bash
   az keyvault secret show --vault-name myKeyVault --name mySecret
   ```

### Conclusion

Azure Key Vault is a powerful service for securely managing secrets, cryptographic keys, and certificates in the cloud. By understanding its core concepts, key features, and best practices, you can effectively safeguard sensitive information and ensure the security and integrity of your applications and services.
