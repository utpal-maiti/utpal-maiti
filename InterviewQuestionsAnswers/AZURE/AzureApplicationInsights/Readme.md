# [Azure Application Insights & Labs](https://github.com/utpal-maiti/Azure_Application_Insights/)

Azure Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics for your live web applications. It helps you understand your application's performance, detect issues, and gain insights into how users interact with your application. Here are the key concepts and features of Azure Application Insights:

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Telemetry Data**

- **Requests**: Logs each request received by your application, including HTTP requests.
- **Dependencies**: Tracks calls made by your application to external services, such as REST APIs or databases.
- **Exceptions**: Captures exceptions and errors that occur in your application.
- **Custom Telemetry**: Allows you to send custom data, such as traces, events, and metrics, to gain deeper insights into your application.

#### 2. **Application Map**

- **Visual Overview**: Provides a visual representation of your application's architecture and the interactions between its components.
- **Dependency Calls**: Shows how different parts of your application communicate with each other and with external services.

#### 3. **Live Metrics**

- **Real-time Analytics**: Offers a real-time dashboard that displays key performance metrics and allows you to monitor your application's health and performance.

#### 4. **Availability Tests**

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Allows you to set up tests to monitor the availability and responsiveness of your application endpoints.

#### 5. **Failures and Performance Views**

- **Identify Issues**: Helps you identify and analyze failures in your application to minimize downtime.
- **Performance Metrics**: Reviews application performance metrics and potential bottlenecks.

#### 6. **Alerts and Notifications**

- **Monitor Aspects**: Configures alerts to monitor various aspects of your application and trigger actions when specific conditions are met.

### Advanced Features

#### 1. **Workbooks**

- **Interactive Reports**: Create interactive reports and dashboards that visualize application monitoring data.

#### 2. **Funnels and Flows**

- **User Paths**: Analyze conversion rates and visualize user paths on your site to identify high engagement areas and exit points.

#### 3. **Code Analysis**

- **Performance Traces**: Capture and analyze performance traces for your application.
- **Code Optimizations**: Use AI-powered tools to create better and more efficient applications.

#### 4. **Snapshot Debugger**

- **Automated Debugging**: Automatically collect debug snapshots when exceptions occur in .NET applications.

### Integration and Compatibility

- **Multiple Platforms**: Supports monitoring for applications built using various platforms, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and more.
- **DevOps Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with DevOps tools and practices to streamline monitoring and diagnostics.

### Getting Started

To start using Azure Application Insights, you need an Azure subscription. You can enable Application Insights for your application either through code or without code, depending on your needs. The Azure portal provides a straightforward setup process, and you can customize the monitoring based on your application's requirements.
