### Core Metrics Monitored by Live Metrics

#### 1. **Request Rate**

- **Definition**: The number of incoming requests per second.
- **Importance**: Helps you understand the load on your application and detect sudden spikes in traffic.

#### 2. **Response Time**

- **Definition**: The time taken to process requests.
- **Importance**: Indicates the performance of your application and helps identify slow responses.

#### 3. **Failure Rate**

- **Definition**: The percentage of failed requests.
- **Importance**: Helps you identify reliability issues in your application.

#### 4. **Dependency Calls**

- **Definition**: Metrics related to calls made to external dependencies, such as databases and APIs.
- **Importance**: Helps you understand the performance and health of external dependencies that your application relies on.

#### 5. **Custom Metrics**

- **Definition**: User-defined metrics that provide insights specific to your application.
- **Importance**: Allows you to track additional performance indicators relevant to your business or technical requirements.

#### 2. **Monitor Live Metrics**

- **Dashboard View**: The Live Metrics dashboard displays key metrics in real-time, including request rates, response times, and failure rates.
- **Customize Metrics**: Add or remove metrics from the dashboard to tailor the view to your specific needs.

#### 3. **Analyze Data in Real-Time**

- **Detect Anomalies**: Monitor the live data stream to detect anomalies in your application’s performance.
- **Investigate Issues**: Drill down into specific metrics to investigate issues and understand their root causes.
- **Take Immediate Action**: Use the real-time insights to take immediate action to address performance or reliability issues.

### Example: Using Live Metrics for Real-Time Monitoring

Here’s an example of how you might use Live Metrics to monitor your application in real-time:

1. **Access Live Metrics Stream**:

   - Navigate to the Azure portal and open the Application Insights resource for your application.
   - In the left-hand menu, click on “Live Metrics Stream.”

2. **Monitor Key Metrics**:

   - The dashboard will display live data for key metrics such as request rates, response times, and failure rates.
   - Customize the view by adding custom metrics or removing metrics that are not relevant to your monitoring needs.

3. **Detect and Respond to Issues**:
   - Monitor the live data stream to detect any anomalies, such as spikes in response times or increased failure rates.
   - Click on specific metrics to drill down into detailed telemetry data and investigate the root cause of issues.
   - Use the insights gained to take immediate action to resolve performance or reliability issues.

### Benefits of Live Metrics

- **Immediate Insights**: Provides instant insights into your application’s performance and health, enabling you to detect and respond to issues in real-time.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Helps you proactively monitor your application and prevent issues before they impact your users.
- **Customization**: Allows you to tailor the metrics monitored to your specific needs, providing insights that are relevant to your business or technical requirements.
