Azure Application Insights provides two key views to help you monitor and diagnose issues in your applications: **Failures View** and **Performance View**. Let's dive into the details of each:

### Failures View

#### **Purpose**

The Failures View tracks errors, exceptions, and faults in your application, offering clear insights for fast problem-solving and enhanced stability.

#### **Key Features**

- **Error Tracking**: Lists all errors and exceptions collected for your application.
- **Detailed Insights**: Drill into each failure to view detailed information, including stack traces, exception messages, and affected transactions.
- **Correlation**: Correlates failed requests with exceptions and other events to quickly diagnose the root cause.
- **Troubleshooting Report**: Provides a detailed end-to-end transaction view, including dependencies and exception details.

#### **How to Access**

- Navigate to the Application Insights resource in the Azure portal.
- In the left-hand menu, under "Investigate," select "Failures".

### Performance View

#### **Purpose**

The Performance View helps you quickly identify and resolve application bottlenecks by displaying response times and operation counts.

#### **Key Features**

- **Response Times**: Displays average response times for requests and operations.
- **Operation Counts**: Shows the number of operations performed by your application.
- **Isolation of Slow Transactions**: Allows you to isolate slow transactions by selecting specific time ranges, operation names, and durations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically identifies anomalies and commonalities across transactions.
- **End-to-End Transaction View**: Provides a Gantt chart of dependencies for detailed transaction analysis.

#### **How to Access**

- Navigate to the Application Insights resource in the Azure portal.
- In the left-hand menu, under "Investigate," select "Performance".

### Benefits of Using Failures and Performance Views

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Helps you proactively monitor your application's health and performance.
- **Quick Issue Detection**: Detects issues early, allowing you to address them before they impact your users.
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Provides detailed insights and diagnostics to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- **Enhanced Stability**: Ensures the ongoing stability and reliability of your application by identifying and addressing failures and bottlenecks.

By leveraging these views, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your application's performance and health, enabling you to maintain a high-quality user experience.
