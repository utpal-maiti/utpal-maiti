Sure! Here are some scenario-based interview questions related to Azure Cosmos DB storage, along with detailed answers to help you prepare:

### Scenario-Based Interview Questions:

#### 1. **Handling High Throughput Workloads**
**Question:** How would you design a Cosmos DB solution to handle high throughput workloads for a social media application with millions of users?

**Answer:** To handle high throughput workloads, you would:
- **Partition Data Efficiently:** Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data and minimizes hotspots.
- **Provision Adequate Throughput:** Estimate the required Request Units (RU/s) based on expected read and write operations and provision accordingly.
- **Enable Multi-Region Writes:** Replicate data across multiple regions to ensure low latency and high availability.
- **Monitor Performance:** Use Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB's built-in metrics to track performance and adjust throughput as needed.

#### 2. **Ensuring Data Consistency**
**Question:** How would you ensure strong consistency for a banking application using Cosmos DB?

**Answer:** To ensure strong consistency:
- **Set Consistency Level:** Configure the consistency level to `Strong` to ensure that reads always return the most recent write for a given partition key.
- **Use ACID Transactions:** Leverage Cosmos DB's support for multi-document ACID transactions to maintain data integrity.
- **Monitor Consistency:** Regularly monitor consistency levels and performance metrics to ensure the application meets consistency requirements.

#### 3. **Optimizing Query Performance**
**Question:** How would you optimize query performance for a Cosmos DB container storing large JSON documents?

**Answer:** To optimize query performance:
- **Use Indexing Policies:** Define appropriate indexing policies to include only necessary paths for indexing.
- **Optimize Queries:** Use filters on partition keys to limit the scope of queries and reduce the amount of data scanned.
- **Monitor Query Metrics:** Use Azure Monitor to track query performance and identify any bottlenecks.

#### 4. **Handling Transient Faults**
**Question:** How would you handle transient faults in a Cosmos DB application?

**Answer:** To handle transient faults:
- **Implement Retry Logic:** Use the built-in retry policies or implement custom retry logic to handle transient faults.
- **Use Exponential Backoff:** Implement exponential backoff with jitter to avoid overwhelming the service during retries.
- **Monitor Errors:** Use Azure Monitor to track and analyze errors, and adjust retry policies based on observed patterns.

#### 5. **Global Distribution and Disaster Recovery**
**Question:** How would you design a Cosmos DB solution for a global e-commerce application with disaster recovery requirements?

**Answer:** To design a solution:
- **Enable Multi-Region Writes:** Replicate data across multiple regions to ensure low latency and high availability.
- **Configure Multi-Master Writes:** Enable multi-master writes to allow writes in any region and replicate to other regions.
- **Set Up Disaster Recovery:** Implement backup and restore strategies to recover data in case of a disaster.
