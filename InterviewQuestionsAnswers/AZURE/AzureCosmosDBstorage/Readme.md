Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service designed for modern app development. It supports various APIs, including SQL (Core), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table, making it versatile for different data models and query languages.

### Key Concepts of Azure Cosmos DB Storage:

1. **Databases, Containers, and Items:**
   - **Databases:** A database is a logical container for a set of containers. It's similar to a namespace in other database systems.
   - **Containers:** Containers store data and are the primary unit of scalability and performance in Cosmos DB. Each container has a unique partition key that determines how data is distributed across physical partitions.
   - **Items:** Items are the individual data records stored within a container. Each item has a unique ID and can contain multiple properties.

2. **Partitioning:**
   - **Logical Partitions:** Data within a container is divided into logical partitions based on the partition key. Logical partitions help distribute data and scale throughput efficiently.
   - **Physical Partitions:** Logical partitions are mapped to physical partitions, which are the actual storage units in Cosmos DB. Each physical partition can handle up to 10,000 Request Units per second and store up to 50 GB of data.

3. **Request Units (RU):**
   - **Throughput:** The performance of operations in Cosmos DB is measured in Request Units (RU), which are a combination of CPU, I/O, and memory resources. You provision throughput (RU/s) for containers to ensure consistent performance.
   - **Provisioned Throughput:** You can set the minimum and maximum RU/s for a container, and Cosmos DB automatically scales the throughput based on the workload.

4. **Consistency Levels:**
   - **Strong Consistency:** Ensures that reads always return the most recent write for a given partition key.
   - **Eventual Consistency:** Provides lower latency and higher throughput by allowing reads to return slightly stale data.
   - **Bounded Staleness:** Allows you to specify a time window during which reads might return stale data.
   - **Session Consistency:** Ensures that reads within a session see the writes of that session, but not necessarily writes from other sessions.
   - **Consistent Prefix:** Ensures that reads see all writes up to a certain point in time, but not necessarily the most recent write.

5. **Global Distribution:**
   - **Multi-Region Replication:** You can replicate data across multiple Azure regions to achieve low latency and high availability.
   - **Multi-Master Writes:** Cosmos DB supports multi-master writes, allowing you to write to any region and have the data replicated to other regions.

### Example: Creating a Cosmos DB Account and Container in C#

Here's an example of how to create a Cosmos DB account and container using the Azure SDK for .NET:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

namespace CosmosDBExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string connectionString = "your_connection_string_here";
            CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(connectionString);

            // Create a new database
            DatabaseResponse databaseResponse = await client.CreateDatabaseAsync("MyDatabase");
            Console.WriteLine($"Database {databaseResponse.Resource.Id} created.");

            // Create a new container
            ContainerResponse containerResponse = await client.GetContainer("MyDatabase", "MyContainer").CreateContainerAsync(new ContainerProperties { PartitionKey = new PartitionKeyDefinition { Paths = new[] { "/partitionKey" } } });
            Console.WriteLine($"Container {containerResponse.Resource.Id} created.");

            Console.WriteLine("Done.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Using Azure Cosmos DB:
1. **Choose the Right API:** Select the API that best fits your data model and query patterns.
2. **Optimize Partition Key:** Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data and maximizes throughput.
3. **Monitor Performance:** Use Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB's built-in metrics to track performance and optimize resource usage.
4. **Use Consistency Levels Wisely:** Balance consistency and performance based on your application's requirements.

By understanding these concepts and best practices, you can effectively use Azure Cosmos DB for scalable and high-performance data storage in your applications. 

Certainly! Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service. It offers a variety of powerful features that make it suitable for modern application development. Letâ€™s explore these features in detail, along with how to use them in C#.

### Key Features of Azure Cosmos DB:

1. **Global Distribution:**
   - Cosmos DB allows you to distribute your data across multiple Azure regions with a single click. This helps in achieving low latency and high availability.
   - You can configure multi-region writes to enhance performance and availability.

   ```csharp
   CosmosClientOptions options = new CosmosClientOptions
   {
       ApplicationRegion = Regions.EastUS,
       EnableReadRequestsFallback = true
   };
   CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient("your_connection_string_here", options);
   ```

2. **Multi-Model Support:**
   - Cosmos DB supports various data models including document (JSON), graph, key-value, table, and column-family data models.
   - You can interact with Cosmos DB using different APIs like SQL (Core) API, MongoDB API, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, and Table API.

3. **Elastic Scale-out:**
   - With Cosmos DB, you can elastically scale both throughput and storage based on your application's needs.
   - You provision throughput in terms of Request Units (RU/s), which can be scaled up or down as needed.

   ```csharp
   DatabaseResponse databaseResponse = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("MyDatabase");
   ContainerResponse containerResponse = await databaseResponse.Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("MyContainer", "/partitionKey", 400);
   ```

4. **Guaranteed Performance and SLAs:**
   - Cosmos DB provides comprehensive Service Level Agreements (SLAs) covering throughput, availability, consistency, and latency.
   - The performance is predictable and backed by SLAs.

5. **Multiple Consistency Levels:**
   - Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels: Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, and Eventual. This allows you to balance between performance and data consistency as per your needs.

   ```csharp
   CosmosClientOptions options = new CosmosClientOptions
   {
       ApplicationRegion = Regions.EastUS,
       ConsistencyLevel = ConsistencyLevel.Session
   };
   CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient("your_connection_string_here", options);
   ```

6. **Integrated Security:**
   - Cosmos DB supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), integration with Azure Active Directory (AAD), and data encryption at rest and in transit.
   
7. **Change Feed:**
   - The Change Feed feature allows you to listen to changes (inserts and updates) to items within a container. This is useful for real-time processing, event sourcing, and more.

   ```csharp
   Container container = client.GetContainer("MyDatabase", "MyContainer");
   FeedIterator<ToDoItem> feedIterator = container.GetChangeFeedIterator<ToDoItem>(
       ChangeFeedStartFrom.Beginning(),
       new ChangeFeedRequestOptions() { StartTime = DateTime.UtcNow });

   while (feedIterator.HasMoreResults)
   {
       FeedResponse<ToDoItem> response = await feedIterator.ReadNextAsync();
       foreach (ToDoItem item in response)
       {
           Console.WriteLine(item.Id);
       }
   }
   ```

    }

    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string connectionString = "your_connection_string_here";
            CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(connectionString);

            // Create database and container
            Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("MyDatabase");
            Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("MyContainer", "/partitionKey", 400);

            // Create a new item
            ToDoItem newItem = new ToDoItem
            {
                Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                PartitionKey = "Partition1",
                Description = "Learn Azure Cosmos DB"
            };
            ItemResponse<ToDoItem> createResponse = await container.CreateItemAsync(newItem, new PartitionKey(newItem.PartitionKey));
            Console.WriteLine($"Created item with id: {createResponse.Resource.Id}");

            // Read an item
            ItemResponse<ToDoItem> readResponse = await container.ReadItemAsync<ToDoItem>(newItem.Id, new PartitionKey(newItem.PartitionKey));
            Console.WriteLine($"Read item with id: {readResponse.Resource.Id}, Description: {readResponse.Resource.Description}");

            // Update an item
            newItem.Description = "Learn Azure Cosmos DB in detail";
            ItemResponse<ToDoItem> updateResponse = await container.UpsertItemAsync(newItem, new PartitionKey(newItem.PartitionKey));
            Console.WriteLine($"Updated item with id: {updateResponse.Resource.Id}, Description: {updateResponse.Resource.Description}");

            // Delete an item
            ItemResponse<ToDoItem> deleteResponse = await container.DeleteItemAsync<ToDoItem>(newItem.Id, new PartitionKey(newItem.PartitionKey));
            Console.WriteLine($"Deleted item with id: {deleteResponse.Resource.Id}");
        }
    }
}
```
