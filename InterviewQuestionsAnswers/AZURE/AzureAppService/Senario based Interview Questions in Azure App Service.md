### Scenario-Based Interview Questions

#### 1. **Migrating an On-Premises Application to Azure App Service**

**Question**: Your company wants to migrate an on-premises web application to Azure App Service. What steps would you take to ensure a smooth migration?

**Answer**:

1. **Assess the Application**: Evaluate the application's architecture, dependencies, and requirements.
2. **Choose the Right Plan**: Select an appropriate App Service plan based on the application's performance and scalability needs.
3. **Create an App Service**: Set up an Azure App Service instance in the Azure portal.
4. **Deploy the Application**: Use deployment methods like FTP, Git, or Azure DevOps to deploy the application to the App Service.
5. **Configure Settings**: Set up environment variables, connection strings, and other configurations.
6. **Test the Application**: Perform thorough testing to ensure the application works as expected in the new environment.
7. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor the application's performance and optimize as needed.

#### 2. **Implementing SSL/TLS for a Custom Domain**

**Question**: You need to configure SSL/TLS for a custom domain in Azure App Service. How would you go about it?

**Answer**:

1. **Purchase or Import a Certificate**: Buy an SSL certificate from a trusted provider or import an existing certificate into Azure Key Vault.
2. **Bind the Certificate**: In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service and select "TLS/SSL settings." Bind the certificate to your custom domain.
3. **Enforce HTTPS**: Ensure that HTTPS is enforced to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
4. **Verify Configuration**: Test the SSL configuration to ensure that the custom domain is accessible via HTTPS.

#### 3. **Scaling an Application During Peak Load**

**Question**: Your web application experiences high traffic during peak hours. How would you scale the application to handle the load?

**Answer**:

1. **Enable Auto-Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling rules in the Azure portal to automatically scale the number of instances based on CPU usage or other metrics.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track the application's performance and identify bottlenecks.
3. **Optimize Resources**: Adjust the App Service plan to allocate more resources during peak hours.
4. **Load Balancing**: Ensure that the load balancer distributes traffic evenly across instances.

#### 4. **Securing an Application with Azure AD Authentication**

**Question**: You need to secure your web application with Azure Active Directory (AD) authentication. What steps would you take?

**Answer**:

1. **Register the Application**: Register the application in Azure AD to obtain the client ID and tenant ID.
2. **Configure Authentication**: In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service and enable App Service Authentication. Select Azure AD as the identity provider.
3. **Set Up Authentication Flow**: Configure the authentication flow in your application code to use Azure AD tokens.
4. **Test Authentication**: Test the authentication setup to ensure that users can sign in and access the application securely.

#### 5. **Handling Application Failures and Downtime**

**Question**: How would you handle application failures and minimize downtime in Azure App Service?

**Answer**:

1. **Enable Auto-Healing**: Configure auto-healing settings to automatically restart instances that become unresponsive.
2. **Set Up Alerts**: Use Azure Monitor to set up alerts for application failures and performance issues.
3. **Implement Backup and Restore**: Configure automated backups and test restore procedures to recover from failures quickly.
4. **Deploy to Multiple Regions**: Deploy the application to multiple regions for high availability and disaster recovery.

These scenario-based questions and answers should help you prepare for interviews focused on Azure App Service.
