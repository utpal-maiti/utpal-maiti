Sure! Let's dive into the concepts of custom domains and SSL in Azure App Service:

### Custom Domains in Azure App Service

#### 1. **Mapping Custom DNS Names**

- **Root Domain**: For the root domain (e.g., `contoso.com`), you need to create an **A record** in your DNS settings. This points the domain to the IP address of your Azure App Service.
- **Subdomain**: For subdomains (e.g., `www.contoso.com`), you can use a **CNAME record** to point the subdomain to the default hostname of your App Service.
- **Wildcard Domains**: For wildcard domains (e.g., `*.contoso.com`), you can also use a **CNAME record**. This allows you to map multiple subdomains to your App Service.

#### 2. **Configuring Custom Domains**

- **Azure Portal**: Navigate to your App Service in the Azure portal. Under "Settings," select "Custom domains" and follow the steps to add your domain.
- **DNS Configuration**: Ensure you have access to your domain provider's DNS settings to configure the necessary records.

#### 3. **App Service Domains**

- **Managed Domains**: Azure App Service offers managed domains that simplify the management of custom domains. You can buy and configure these domains directly within the Azure portal.
- **Third-Party Domains**: You can also use third-party domains and integrate them with Azure App Service.

### SSL Concepts in Azure App Service

#### 1. **SSL/TLS Certificates**

- **Managed Certificates**: Azure App Service provides free managed certificates for SSL/TLS, which are automatically renewed and managed by Azure.
- **Imported Certificates**: You can import your own certificates from Azure Key Vault or upload a certificate from a third-party provider.
- **Public Certificates**: These certificates are used for accessing remote resources and are not used to secure custom domains.

#### 2. **Configuring SSL/TLS**

- **Azure Portal**: In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service and select "TLS/SSL settings." Here, you can configure SSL bindings and enforce HTTPS.
- **Auto-Renewal**: Managed certificates are automatically renewed before expiration.
- **Certificate Requirements**: Ensure your certificate meets the requirements for Azure App Service, such as being in the Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier.

#### 3. **Using Certificates in Code**

- **Thumbprint**: To use a certificate in your application code, you need to add the certificate's thumbprint to the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` app setting.
- **Accessing Certificates**: In your code, you can access the certificate using its thumbprint.

### Example: Configuring a Custom Domain with SSL

1. **Map the Domain**: Add the necessary DNS records (A or CNAME) for your custom domain.
2. **Azure Portal**: In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service and select "Custom domains." Follow the steps to add your domain.
3. **SSL Binding**: Under "TLS/SSL settings," configure the SSL binding and select the certificate you want to use.
4. **Enforce HTTPS**: Ensure that HTTPS is enforced to secure your custom domain.

By following these steps, you can securely configure custom domains and SSL/TLS certificates for your Azure App Service applications.
