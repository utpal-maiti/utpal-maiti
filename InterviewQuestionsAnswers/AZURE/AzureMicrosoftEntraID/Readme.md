# [Azure Microsoft Entra ID & Labs](https://github.com/utpal-maiti/Azure_Microsoft_Entra_ID/)

**Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly known as Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft. It helps organizations manage user identities and access to resources both within and outside their corporate networks. Here are some key concepts and details:

### **Core Concepts**
1. **Identity**: Anything that can be authenticated, such as a user with a username and password, applications, or services.
2. **Account**: An identity with associated data, such as user profiles.
3. **Azure Entra ID Account**: An identity created using Azure Entra ID or other Microsoft cloud services.

### **Key Features**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to sign in once and gain access to multiple applications and services without needing to re-authenticate.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification to access resources.
- **Conditional Access**: Policies that enforce access controls based on conditions such as user location, device compliance, and risk level.
- **Identity Protection**: Tools to detect and respond to identity-based threats, such as compromised credentials.
- **Provisioning and Deprovisioning**: Automates the process of creating, updating, and removing user accounts and access rights.
- **Access Reviews**: Regularly review and audit access rights to ensure they are appropriate and up-to-date.

### **Use Cases**
- **External Resources**: Access to Microsoft 365, Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.
- **Internal Resources**: Access to apps on corporate networks and intranets, as well as cloud apps developed by the organization.
- **Integration with On-Premises AD**: Use Azure AD Connect to integrate with existing on-premises Active Directory environments.

### **Benefits**
- **Centralized Management**: Simplifies the management of user identities and access controls across various platforms and applications.
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides robust security features to protect against identity-based threats.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to accommodate growing numbers of users and applications.
- **Compliance**: Helps organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements by providing audit trails and access controls.

### **Licensing**
- **Microsoft Entra ID Free**: Comes with subscriptions to Microsoft Online business services like Microsoft 365 and Azure.
- **Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2**: Paid licenses that offer additional features such as advanced security, identity protection, and governance tools.
