Certainly! Here are some detailed best practices for developing applications with AngularJS:

### 1. **Modular Architecture**

- **Use Modules**: Break your application into smaller, manageable modules. This helps in organizing the code and makes it easier to maintain and test.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading to improve initial load times by loading modules only when needed [1](https://kmfinfotech.com/blogs/mastering-angularjs-best-practices-for-developing-high-performance-web-applications/).

### 2. **ControllerAs Syntax**

- **Avoid $scope**: Use the `controllerAs` syntax instead of `$scope` to avoid issues with scope inheritance and to make your controllers more readable and maintainable [2](https://www.toptal.com/angular-js/tips-and-practices).

### 3. **Minimize Watchers**

- **Optimize ng-repeat**: Use `ng-repeat` wisely to limit the number of watchers. Avoid deep watcher checks by limiting the scope of `ng-repeat` to smaller sets of data [1](https://kmfinfotech.com/blogs/mastering-angularjs-best-practices-for-developing-high-performance-web-applications/).
- **Use One-Time Binding**: For data that does not need to be updated, use one-time binding by prefixing the expression with `::`. This reduces the number of watchers and improves performance [1](https://kmfinfotech.com/blogs/mastering-angularjs-best-practices-for-developing-high-performance-web-applications/).

### 4. **Debounce Input Handling**

- **Implement Debounce**: When processing user input, such as keystrokes in a search field, use debounce strategies to reduce the number of digest cycles. Libraries like Lodash can be helpful for this [1](https://kmfinfotech.com/blogs/mastering-angularjs-best-practices-for-developing-high-performance-web-applications/).

### 5. **Optimize Data Binding**

- **Use One-Way Data Binding**: For data that does not need to be updated from the view to the model, use one-way data binding to improve performance [1](https://kmfinfotech.com/blogs/mastering-angularjs-best-practices-for-developing-high-performance-web-applications/).

### 6. **Use Dependency Injection**

- **Leverage Dependency Injection**: AngularJS's dependency injection system helps manage dependencies and makes the code more modular and testable [2](https://www.toptal.com/angular-js/tips-and-practices).

### 7. **Follow Coding Standards**

- **Use Code Linters**: Incorporate code linters into the development process to ensure that the code is clean, readable, and consistent [3](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-best-practices-for-angularjs-developers-to-improve-code-quality). This helps catch bugs early and enforce coding standards.

### 8. **Testing**

- **Write Unit Tests**: Ensure that you write unit tests for your controllers, services, and directives. This helps in catching bugs early and ensures that the code works as expected.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Implement end-to-end testing to test the application flow and user interactions.

### 9. **Performance Optimization**

- **Minimize Digest Cycles**: Reduce the number of digest cycles by optimizing the use of watchers and bindings.
- **Use AngularJS Built-in Tools**: Utilize AngularJS built-in tools like `$applyAsync` and `$timeout` to manage digest cycles efficiently.

### 10. **Documentation**

- **Document Your Code**: Maintain proper documentation for your code to make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.

### Example Code Snippet

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MainController', function () {
	var vm = this;
	vm.title = 'Hello, AngularJS!';
});
```

Following these best practices will help you build high-performance, maintainable, and scalable AngularJS applications.
