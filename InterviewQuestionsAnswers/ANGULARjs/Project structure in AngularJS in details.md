Sure! Here's a detailed overview of the project structure in AngularJS:

### 1. **Root Directory**

The root directory typically contains the main configuration files and folders for the project. Key files include:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
- **bower.json**: If using Bower for package management, this file lists the dependencies.

### 2. **App Directory**

The `app` directory is where most of the application code resides. It usually includes:

- **app.js**: The main JavaScript file that initializes the AngularJS module.
- **controllers/**: Contains controller files, which manage the data and behavior of the application.
- **services/**: Contains service files, which provide reusable business logic and data access.
- **directives/**: Contains custom directive files, which extend HTML with new attributes and elements.
- **filters/**: Contains filter files, which format data displayed in the view.
- **views/**: Contains HTML templates for different parts of the application.

### 3. **Assets Directory**

The `assets` directory holds static files such as images, stylesheets, and fonts. It typically includes:

- **css/**: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
- **images/**: Contains image files used in the application.
- **fonts/**: Contains font files used in the application.

### 4. **Config Directory**

The `config` directory contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, production). It may include:

- **environment.js**: Configuration settings for different environments.
- **routes.js**: Defines the routes for the application.

### 5. **Lib Directory**

The `lib` directory contains third-party libraries and frameworks used in the application. It typically includes:

- **angular/**: Contains AngularJS library files.
- **jquery/**: Contains jQuery library files (if used).

### 6. **Test Directory**

The `test` directory contains test files for unit and end-to-end testing. It usually includes:

- **unit/**: Contains unit test files.
- **e2e/**: Contains end-to-end test files.

### Example Structure

```
my-angular-app/
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── bower.json
├── app/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── directives/
│   ├── filters/
│   ├── views/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── fonts/
├── config/
│   ├── environment.js
│   ├── routes.js
├── lib/
│   ├── angular/
│   ├── jquery/
├── test/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── e2e/
```

This structure helps organize the code and assets in a way that makes the application modular and maintainable.
