Sure, let's explore some scenario-based interview questions related to Dapper and C# that could be helpful for preparing for your interview:

### 1. Basic Data Retrieval
**Scenario**: You need to fetch all users from the database whose age is above 25.
**Question**: How would you retrieve this data using Dapper, and how do you ensure the query is secure?

**Answer**:
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > @Age";
var users = db.Query<User>(sql, new { Age = 25 });
```
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### 2. Handling Multiple Results
**Scenario**: You need to fetch data from two related tables: Users and Orders. 
**Question**: How would you retrieve and map this data using Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
string sql = @"
    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @UserId;
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE UserId = @UserId";
using (var multi = db.QueryMultiple(sql, new { UserId = 1 }))
{
    var user = multi.Read<User>().FirstOrDefault();
    var orders = multi.Read<Order>().ToList();
}
```

### 3. Executing Stored Procedures
**Scenario**: You need to fetch a user by their ID using a stored procedure.
**Question**: How would you call the stored procedure and handle the result in Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>("GetUserById", new { Id = 1 }, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);
```

### 4. Transaction Management
**Scenario**: You need to insert a new user and their corresponding orders in a single transaction.
**Question**: How would you ensure that both operations are either committed or rolled back together?

**Answer**:
```csharp
using (var transaction = db.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
        db.Execute(sql, new { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 }, transaction);

        sql = "INSERT INTO Orders (UserId, OrderDate) VALUES (@UserId, @OrderDate)";
        db.Execute(sql, new { UserId = 1, OrderDate = DateTime.Now }, transaction);

        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
        throw;
    }
}
```

### 5. Bulk Insert
**Scenario**: You need to insert multiple users into the database at once.
**Question**: How would you efficiently perform this operation using Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
var users = new List<User>
{
    new User { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 },
    new User { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 }
};
db.Execute(sql, users);
```

### 6. Handling Complex Types
**Scenario**: You have a complex type with nested objects, like an Order with its associated Customer.
**Question**: How would you map these types using Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
string sql = @"
    SELECT * FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerId = c.Id
    WHERE o.OrderId = @OrderId";
var order = db.Query<Order, Customer, Order>(
    sql,
    (order, customer) => {
        order.Customer = customer;
        return order;
    },
    new { OrderId = 1 }
).FirstOrDefault();
```

### 7. Asynchronous Operations
**Scenario**: You need to fetch user data asynchronously.
**Question**: How would you implement this using Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var user = await db.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 8. Custom Mappings
**Scenario**: You need to map a database column to a different property name in your C# class.
**Question**: How would you achieve this with Dapper?

**Answer**:
```csharp
public class User
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    [Column("User_Name")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 9. Exception Handling
**Scenario**: You want to handle exceptions gracefully when executing Dapper queries.
**Question**: How would you implement robust exception handling in your Dapper-based code?

**Answer**:
```csharp
try
{
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
    var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
}
catch (SqlException ex)
{
    // Handle SQL exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle other exceptions
}
```

These scenario-based questions should help you prepare for interviews and demonstrate your understanding of Dapper in practical situations.
