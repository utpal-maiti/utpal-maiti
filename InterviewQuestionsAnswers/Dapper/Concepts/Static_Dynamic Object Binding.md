Static and dynamic object binding in Dapper are two approaches to map the results of a SQL query to C# objects. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

### Static Object Binding

Static object binding means that the result of the query is bound to a statically typed object, i.e., a class with a fixed structure defined at compile time.

#### Example:
Consider the following `User` class:

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

#### Usage:
You can map the results of a query to a list of `User` objects as follows:

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT UserId, Name, Age FROM Users";
var users = db.Query<User>(sql).ToList();
```

**Advantages of Static Object Binding:**
1. **Compile-time Safety**: The compiler can catch errors such as misspelled property names.
2. **Intellisense Support**: You get Intellisense support in IDEs, making it easier to write and maintain code.
3. **Better Performance**: Since the structure is known at compile time, object creation is more efficient.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Less Flexibility**: If the query results vary dynamically, you need to modify the class definitions accordingly.

### Dynamic Object Binding

Dynamic object binding means that the result of the query is bound to a dynamically typed object, i.e., an object whose structure can change at runtime.

#### Example:
You can use the `dynamic` keyword to handle results dynamically:

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT UserId, Name, Age FROM Users";
var users = db.Query<dynamic>(sql).ToList();
```

You can then access the properties dynamically:

```csharp
foreach (var user in users)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"UserId: {user.UserId}, Name: {user.Name}, Age: {user.Age}");
}
```

**Advantages of Dynamic Object Binding:**
1. **Flexibility**: You can handle results with varying structures without changing the class definitions.
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Useful for quick experiments or when the schema is not well defined.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Runtime Errors**: Errors such as misspelled property names are only caught at runtime, not at compile time.
2. **No Intellisense Support**: You don't get Intellisense support, making it harder to write and maintain code.
3. **Performance Overhead**: Dynamic object creation and property access can be slower compared to static binding.

### Combining Static and Dynamic Binding

You can combine both approaches when needed. For example, you can use a static type for well-known parts of the result and dynamic types for less predictable parts.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class User
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public dynamic AdditionalData { get; set; }
}

string sql = "SELECT UserId, Name, Age, OtherColumn FROM Users";
var users = db.Query<User, dynamic, User>(
    sql,
    (user, additionalData) =>
    {
        user.AdditionalData = additionalData;
        return user;
    }
).ToList();
```

### Conclusion

Both static and dynamic object binding have their own use cases and benefits. Static binding is ideal for well-defined schemas and offers compile-time safety and better performance. Dynamic binding, on the other hand, offers flexibility and is useful for handling varying result structures. Depending on your application needs, you can choose the approach that best fits your requirements or combine both as needed.
