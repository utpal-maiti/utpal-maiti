Achieving high performance with Dapper in C# involves several strategies and best practices to optimize your database interactions. Here are some key techniques to ensure your Dapper-based applications run efficiently:

### 1. Use Batching for Multiple Inserts/Updates
Instead of executing multiple individual insert or update statements, batch them together to minimize round trips to the database.
```csharp
string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
var users = new List<User>
{
    new User { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 },
    new User { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 }
};
db.Execute(sql, users);
```

### 2. Optimize SQL Queries
Write efficient SQL queries by:
- Limiting the number of columns retrieved to only those you need.
- Using appropriate indexes.
- Avoiding complex joins and subqueries when possible.
- Using stored procedures for complex operations.

### 3. Use Asynchronous Methods
Leverage asynchronous Dapper methods to prevent blocking calls and improve the responsiveness of your application.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var user = await db.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 4. Cache Results
For data that doesn't change often, consider caching the results to reduce the number of database calls.
```csharp
var cacheKey = "AllUsers";
var users = memoryCache.GetOrCreate(cacheKey, entry =>
{
    entry.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
    return db.Query<User>("SELECT * FROM Users").ToList();
});
```

### 5. Use Transactions Wisely
Use transactions for a group of operations that need to be executed as a unit to ensure data integrity, but avoid keeping transactions open for longer than necessary.
```csharp
using (var transaction = db.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
        db.Execute(sql, new { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 }, transaction);

        sql = "INSERT INTO Orders (UserId, OrderDate) VALUES (@UserId, @OrderDate)";
        db.Execute(sql, new { UserId = 1, OrderDate = DateTime.Now }, transaction);

        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
        throw;
    }
}
```

### 6. Minimize Object Mapping
Map only the necessary columns to your objects. If you only need a subset of the data, avoid creating large, complex objects.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT UserId, Name FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 7. Use Buffered and Unbuffered Reads Appropriately
Dapper provides the option to use buffered or unbuffered reads. Buffered reads (default) load the entire result set into memory, while unbuffered reads stream the results and are more memory-efficient for large datasets.
```csharp
var users = db.Query<User>("SELECT * FROM Users", buffered: false);
```

### 8. Limit Data Retrieval
Limit the number of rows returned by using pagination or top N queries to reduce memory usage and increase performance.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Users ORDER BY UserId";
var users = db.Query<User>(sql);
```

### 9. Indexing
Ensure your database tables have appropriate indexes to speed up query execution. Use indexes on frequently queried columns and on foreign keys.

### 10. Connection Pooling
Make use of connection pooling to reuse database connections, reducing the overhead of creating and disposing of connections.
```csharp
string connectionString = "YourConnectionString;Pooling=true;Min Pool Size=5;Max Pool Size=50;";
using (IDbConnection db = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    // Execute Dapper queries here
}
```

### 11. Profiling and Monitoring
Regularly profile and monitor your database and application to identify performance bottlenecks. Use tools like SQL Server Profiler, Entity Framework Profiler, or built-in logging to analyze query performance.
