Dapper is a popular, lightweight Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. Here are some of its key features:

1. **High Performance**: Dapper is known for its speed and efficiency, often outperforming other ORMs.
2. **Static/Dynamic Object Binding**: It supports both static and dynamic object binding, giving developers flexibility in how they map objects.
3. **Easy SQL Query Handling**: Dapper simplifies the process of writing and executing SQL queries.
4. **Multiple Query Support**: It can handle multiple queries simultaneously.
5. **Stored Procedure Support**: Dapper makes it easy to work with stored procedures.
6. **Directly Operates on IDbConnection**: It extends the IDbConnection interface, providing useful extension methods.
7. **Bulk Data Insert**: Dapper supports bulk data insert functionality, making it easier to handle large datasets.
Sure, let's delve into the key concepts of Dapper using C#:

### 1. Setting Up Dapper
To get started with Dapper, you need to install the Dapper NuGet package. You can do this via the Package Manager Console:
```shell
Install-Package Dapper
```

### 2. Connection Management
Dapper operates directly on the `IDbConnection` interface, which means you need an open database connection to execute your queries.
```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Dapper;

string connectionString = "YourConnectionString";
using (IDbConnection db = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    db.Open();
    // Execute Dapper queries here
}
```

### 3. Basic Query Execution
Dapper uses extension methods to execute SQL queries and map the results to your C# objects.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
User user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 4. Parameterized Queries
Dapper supports parameterized queries, which helps in preventing SQL injection.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 5. Inserting Data
You can insert data using Dapper by executing an `INSERT` statement.
```csharp
string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
var affectedRows = db.Execute(sql, new { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 });
```

### 6. Updating Data
Updating data is similar to inserting. You use the `UPDATE` statement.
```csharp
string sql = "UPDATE Users SET Name = @Name, Age = @Age WHERE UserId = @Id";
var affectedRows = db.Execute(sql, new { Name = "Jane Doe", Age = 25, Id = 1 });
```

### 7. Deleting Data
Deleting data follows the same pattern.
```csharp
string sql = "DELETE FROM Users WHERE UserId = @Id";
var affectedRows = db.Execute(sql, new { Id = 1 });
```

### 8. Stored Procedures
Dapper makes it easy to execute stored procedures.
```csharp
var user = db.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>("GetUserById", new { Id = 1 }, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);
```

### 9. Multiple Query Support
Dapper can handle multiple queries and map them to multiple objects.
```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users; SELECT * FROM Orders";
using (var multi = db.QueryMultiple(sql))
{
    var users = multi.Read<User>().ToList();
    var orders = multi.Read<Order>().ToList();
}
```

### 10. Transactions
Dapper supports transactions, allowing you to execute a set of commands as a single unit.
```csharp
using (var transaction = db.BeginTransaction())
{
    string sql = "INSERT INTO Users (Name, Age) VALUES (@Name, @Age)";
    db.Execute(sql, new { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 }, transaction);
    transaction.Commit();
}
```

These examples should give you a solid foundation to start using Dapper in your C# projects.
