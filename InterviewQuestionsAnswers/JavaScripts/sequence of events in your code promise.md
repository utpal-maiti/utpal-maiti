const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { console.log(1); setTimeout(() => { console.log("timerStart"); resolve("success"); console.log("timerEnd"); }, 0); console.log(2); }); promise.then((res) => { console.log(res); }); console.log(4); what would be output
Here's the sequence of events in your code, along with the output that would be printed to the console:

1. The `Promise` object is created, and the executor function is called immediately.
2. `console.log(1)` is executed, so `1` is printed.
3. `setTimeout` is called with a delay of 0 milliseconds, but its callback function is added to the event queue.
4. `console.log(2)` is executed, so `2` is printed.
5. The `Promise` executor function completes, and `promise.then` is called to attach a fulfillment handler to the `Promise`.
6. `console.log(4)` is executed, so `4` is printed.
7. The event loop processes the `setTimeout` callback, and the following occurs:
   - `console.log("timerStart")` is executed, so `timerStart` is printed.
   - `resolve("success")` is called, fulfilling the `Promise`.
   - `console.log("timerEnd")` is executed, so `timerEnd` is printed.
8. The `Promise` fulfillment handler (`then` callback) is executed with the resolved value ("success"), so `console.log(res)` is executed, printing `success`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
```
1
2
4
timerStart
timerEnd
success
```
