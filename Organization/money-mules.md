### **Money Mules**

**Money Mules** are individuals, knowingly or unknowingly, used to launder illegally obtained funds. Scammers persuade them to receive and transfer stolen money in exchange for commissions. These funds are moved across multiple accounts to obscure the fraudster’s identity. Involvement in such activities, whether intentional or not, is illegal and carries severe legal consequences.

### ✅ DO

- **Scrutinise Job Offers:** Be cautious of unsolicited jobs involving money transfers. Research the company’s or individual’s legitimacy.
- **Guard Financial Information:** Never share bank account details or personal information with unknown parties.
- **Report Suspicious Activity:** Contact authorities if you suspect a money mule scheme.

---

### ❌ DON’T

- **Don’t Share Accounts:** Never let others use your account to receive or transfer funds.
- **Refuse Commissions:** Reject offers to handle unauthorised money for a fee.
- **Know the Risks:** Transferring illegitimate funds can lead to serious legal action.
