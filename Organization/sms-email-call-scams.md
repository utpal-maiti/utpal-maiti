### **SMS, Email & Call Scams**

**SMS, Email & Call Scams** are used by fraudsters to deceive victims with fake offers. They impersonate trusted NBFCs by using their logos and fake IDs, gaining credibility. Scammers may send counterfeit sanction letters or cheques, asking for upfront payments. Once the payment is made, the fraudsters disappear with the money.
