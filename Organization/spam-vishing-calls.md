### **Spam/Vishing Calls**

**Spam/Vishing Calls (voice phishing)** are a deceptive form of cybercrime. Fraudsters use social engineering to trick victims into revealing sensitive information, like personal or financial data. They often impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks or government agencies, using tactics like caller ID spoofing and urgency to gain trust and steal information.

### ✅ DO

- **Use Call Blockers:** Install call-blocking apps and report spam calls.
- **Be Cautious:** Exercise caution when answering calls from unknown numbers.
- **Spread Awareness:** Educate others about common phone scams.
- **Enable Security:** Use voicemail passwords for added protection.

### ❌ DON’T

- **Don’t Share Personal Info:** Never provide personal or financial information to unknown callers.
- **Don’t Trust Caller ID:** Caller ID can be spoofed, so don’t rely on it.
- **Avoid Unknown Numbers:** Don’t return calls from unfamiliar or international numbers.
- **Protect Your Data:** Genuine institutions never ask for sensitive info like usernames, passwords, or OTPs. Never share these, even with family.
