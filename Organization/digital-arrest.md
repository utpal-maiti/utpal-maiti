**Digital Arrest**

Digital Arrest is when someone is detained or restricted through digital means (like video calls) instead of traditional physical arrest methods. This often involves scammers impersonating government officials to extort money.

---

### ✅ DO

- Know the Facts: Police or government officials never ask for money through video calls.
- Don’t Share Personal Information: Scammers may ask for your personal details like bank account information. Report such incidents immediately on the “Report Suspect Tab” of www.cybercrime.gov.in.
- Understand the Law: There is no such thing as a “digital arrest” by police in India.

---

### ❌ DON’T

- Don’t Panic: Stay calm and avoid falling for scams.
- Don’t Give In to Scammers: Don’t send any money or disclose your personal information over video calls from unknown sources.
- Don’t Trust Unverified Calls: Ignore all suspicious calls claiming to be from government officials.
