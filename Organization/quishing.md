**Quishing**

Quishing Scams are on the rise. The scammer lures victims with promises of deals or convenience by asking to scan QR codes but ultimately initiate unauthorized financial transactions. Malicious codes can redirect users to phishing sites, steal login credentials, or transfer money directly to the scammer's account.

---

### ✅ DO

- Scan Trusted Sources: Only scan QR codes from official websites or verified businesses.
- Verify Before Acting: Scammers create urgency—take your time to verify.
- Report Suspicious Codes: If you suspect a scam, report the code using legitimate sources and relevant authorities.

---

### ❌ DON’T

- Be Cautious with Payments: Avoid scanning QR codes for making payments unless you are sure of the source.
- Don't Scan to Receive Money: Never scan a code if someone claims it will help you receive money.
- Avoid Unfamiliar Codes: Avoid scanning unfamiliar codes requesting banking details like m-PIN or passwords.
- Don't Share Sensitive Info: Don't scan codes from emails, texts, or unfamiliar sources.
