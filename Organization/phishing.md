### **Phishing**

**Phishing** is a common cybercrime tactic that deceives victims into clicking on fake links. These links appear as emails or websites from trusted sources but redirect users to fraudulent sites designed to steal sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, or financial details. Phishing can also install malware, giving cybercriminals unauthorised access to your device.

### ✅ DO

- **Be Suspicious:** Treat unexpected messages from known sources with caution.
- **Check URLs:** Hover over links to reveal the genuine destination and spot discrepancies.
- **Verify Senders:** Contact the sender through a trusted method if you're unsure about a message’s authenticity.
- **Update Regularly:** Keep your software and systems up-to-date to close security gaps.
- **Phishing Report:** Alert the relevant authorities or platforms if you encounter phishing attempts.

---

### ❌ DON’T

- **Avoid Clicking Links:** Don’t click on suspicious links; delete messages from unknown senders immediately.
- **Unsubscribe & Block:** Unsubscribe from emails with suspicious links and block the sender’s email.
- **Visit Official Websites:** Always go directly to the official website for financial transactions and verify website security (HTTPS with a padlock).
