### **Search Engine Fraud**

**Search Engine Fraud** occurs when fraudsters manipulate search results to display fake contact information, posing as legitimate entities. Victims who unknowingly call these numbers may reveal sensitive information, such as passwords and account details, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and other severe consequences.

### ✅ **DO**

- **Visit Official Websites**: Always check the official website for contact details, rather than relying on search results.
- **Verify Contacts**: Double-check phone numbers and websites using caller ID or trusted directories before sharing personal info.
- **Watch for Red Flags**: Be wary of urgency, scare tactics, or suspicious offers. Legitimate companies don't pressure immediate action.

---

### ❌ **DON’T**

- **Don't Trust Search Results**: Never call numbers listed in search engine results; fraudsters often disguise themselves as an illegitimate entity.
- **Don't Share Info Unprompted**: Only share personal details over the phone if you’ve initiated the contact.
