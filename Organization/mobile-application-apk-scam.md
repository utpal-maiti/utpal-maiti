**Mobile Application APK Scam**
Cybercriminals create Fake Mobile Banking Apps that closely resemble legitimate ones, using similar logos and interfaces. These apps are distributed through unofficial channels like third-party app stores or phishing links. Once installed, they lead to your banking credentials and identity data, leading to financial fraud and theft.
